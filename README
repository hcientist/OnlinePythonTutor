Summary:
 
  Online Python Tutor enables teachers and students to write Python
  programs directly in the web browser, execute those programs, and then
  step forwards and backwards through execution to view the run-time
  state of data structures.

  So far, over 100,000 people have used Online Python Tutor to
  understand and debug their programs, often as a supplement to
  textbooks, lecture notes, and online programming tutorials.

  hi python fans (and non-fans) ...

  this is what i've been hacking on for the past few days instead of
  doing my research ;)  i'm planning to use it as a platform for
  creating interactive online programming tutorials as part of a
  volunteer project ...

  http://python.pgrind.com/

  it'd be great to get your feedback on what i have so far.  i'd love
  to hear suggestions or complaints.  thanks in advance!

  please don't share this link yet, mostly because my app is still
  buggy and insecure (i definitely don't want random peoples from the
  internet trying to hack it right now!)

  Dear subset of people who cared about my prior email from almost 2
  years ago ...

  I've recently kicked it up a notch with a "2.0" version and am about
  to do a public release soon.  I'd really appreciate any feedback,
  criticism, and especially bug reports on Internet Explorer ;)

  http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/opt-prerelease/

  Please don't share the link yet since it will be dead soon when I
  move this app to its permanent home.  I just want to get some early
  feedback to eliminate the obviously embarrassing bugs before launch.

  THANKS!

  Online Python Tutor: Web-Based Program Visualization for CS Education

  As part of his CS education work at Google, +Philip Guo has been
  developing an open-source educational tool called Online Python Tutor
  (http://www.pythontutor.com). This tool enables teachers and students
  to write Python programs directly in the web browser and then
  single-step forwards and backwards to visualize what the computer is
  doing as it executes those programs.

  Program visualization for CS education is nothing new -- researchers
  have been developing these sorts of tools for decades. However, most
  of these tools never reach far beyond the confines of the researchers'
  home universities due to the difficulty of installing and configuring
  the visualization software. What makes Online Python Tutor unique and
  effective is that it's the first known tool to adapt time-tested ideas
  from the research literature (e.g., rendering of box-and-pointer
  diagrams) for a web-based environment. Now anyone with a modern
  browser can create, explore, and share their program visualizations by
  simply visiting a web URL.

  This ease of access has been a major contributor to adoption: So far,
  over 100,000 people have used Online Python Tutor to understand and
  debug their programs, often as a supplement to learning from
  textbooks, lecture notes, and online programming tutorials. In
  addition, instructors in over a dozen universities such as MIT, UC
  Berkeley, and the University of Washington have used it for teaching
  introductory computer science courses.

  But this is just the beginning. Philip and his colleagues are now
  building an online authoring environment so that, within the next few
  months, teachers and students will be able to save their code snippets
  and add annotations, discussion threads, lessons, and interactive
  exercises on top of the associated visualizations.

  They are also actively seeking partnerships with educators at all
  grade levels to deploy and improve Online Python Tutor. Please contact
  Philip directly or re-share this post with educators who might be
  interested in working with this tool in any capacity.

  Visit www.pythontutor.com to learn more and to start visualizing your
  Python programs now!
