Valgrind detected that your program requires
the following unimplemented functionality:
   Support for program header PT_SUNW_SYSSTAT_ZONE.
This may be because the functionality is hard to implement,
or because no reasonable program would behave this way,
or because nobody has yet needed it.  In any case, let us know at
www.valgrind.org and/or try to work around the problem, if you can.

Valgrind has to exit now.  Sorry.  Bye!
