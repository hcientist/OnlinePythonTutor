# Bug 162020: running an empty executable used to crash Valgrind.  Note that
# the (old) crash message gets filtered out, so it's the presence of the
# blank two lines in the .stderr.exp file that are important -- they
# indicate it ran to completion.  If the crash occurs, the .stderr.out file
# is empty.
prereq: touch empty-exe && chmod u+x empty-exe
prog: empty-exe
vgopts:
cleanup: rm -f empty-exe
