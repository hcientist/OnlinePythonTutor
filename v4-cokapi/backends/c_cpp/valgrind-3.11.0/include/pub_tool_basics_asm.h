// See pub_tool_basics.h for the purpose of these macros.
//
// Note that although the macros here (which are used in asm files) have the
// same name as those in pub_tool_basics.h (which are used in C files), they
// have different definitions.  Actually, on Linux the definitions are the
// same, but on Darwin they are different.  The reason is that C names on
// Darwin always get a '_' prepended to them by the compiler.  But in order to
// refer to them from asm code, we have to add the '_' ourselves.  Having two
// versions of these macros makes that difference transparent, so we can use
// VG_/ML_ in both asm and C files.
//
// Note also that the exact prefixes used have to match those used in
// pub_tool_basics.h.
