<p>This chapter describes the Valgrind core services, command-line
options and behaviours.  That means it is relevant regardless of what
particular tool you are using.  The information should be sufficient for you
to make effective day-to-day use of Valgrind.  Advanced topics related to
the Valgrind core are described in <a class="xref" href="manual-core-adv.html" title="3. Using and understanding the Valgrind core: Advanced Topics">Valgrind's core: advanced topics</a>.
</p>
<p>
A point of terminology: most references to "Valgrind" in this chapter
refer to the Valgrind core services.  </p>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="manual-core.whatdoes"></a>2.1. What Valgrind does with your program</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Valgrind is designed to be as non-intrusive as possible. It works
directly with existing executables. You don't need to recompile, relink,
or otherwise modify the program to be checked.</p>
<p>You invoke Valgrind like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
valgrind [valgrind-options] your-prog [your-prog-options]</pre>
<p>The most important option is <code class="option">--tool</code> which dictates
which Valgrind tool to run.  For example, if want to run the command
<code class="computeroutput">ls -l</code> using the memory-checking tool
Memcheck, issue this command:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
valgrind --tool=memcheck ls -l</pre>
<p>However, Memcheck is the default, so if you want to use it you can
omit the <code class="option">--tool</code> option.</p>
<p>Regardless of which tool is in use, Valgrind takes control of your
program before it starts.  Debugging information is read from the
executable and associated libraries, so that error messages and other
outputs can be phrased in terms of source code locations, when
appropriate.</p>
<p>Your program is then run on a synthetic CPU provided by the
Valgrind core.  As new code is executed for the first time, the core
hands the code to the selected tool.  The tool adds its own
instrumentation code to this and hands the result back to the core,
which coordinates the continued execution of this instrumented
code.</p>
<p>The amount of instrumentation code added varies widely between
tools.  At one end of the scale, Memcheck adds code to check every
memory access and every value computed,
making it run 10-50 times slower than natively.
At the other end of the spectrum, the minimal tool, called Nulgrind,
adds no instrumentation at all and causes in total "only" about a 4 times
slowdown.</p>
<p>Valgrind simulates every single instruction your program executes.
Because of this, the active tool checks, or profiles, not only the code
in your application but also in all supporting dynamically-linked libraries,
including the C library, graphical libraries, and so on.</p>
<p>If you're using an error-detection tool, Valgrind may
detect errors in system libraries, for example the GNU C or X11
libraries, which you have to use.  You might not be interested in these
errors, since you probably have no control over that code.  Therefore,
Valgrind allows you to selectively suppress errors, by recording them in
a suppressions file which is read when Valgrind starts up.  The build
mechanism selects default suppressions which give reasonable
behaviour for the OS and libraries detected on your machine.
To make it easier to write suppressions, you can use the
<code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> option.  This tells Valgrind to
print out a suppression for each reported error, which you can then
copy into a suppressions file.</p>
<p>Different error-checking tools report different kinds of errors.
The suppression mechanism therefore allows you to say which tool or
tool(s) each suppression applies to.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="manual-core.started"></a>2.2. Getting started</h2></div></div></div>
<p>First off, consider whether it might be beneficial to recompile
your application and supporting libraries with debugging info enabled
(the <code class="option">-g</code> option).  Without debugging info, the best
Valgrind tools will be able to do is guess which function a particular
piece of code belongs to, which makes both error messages and profiling
output nearly useless.  With <code class="option">-g</code>, you'll get
messages which point directly to the relevant source code lines.</p>
<p>Another option you might like to consider, if you are working with
C++, is <code class="option">-fno-inline</code>.  That makes it easier to see the
function-call chain, which can help reduce confusion when navigating
around large C++ apps.  For example, debugging
OpenOffice.org with Memcheck is a bit easier when using this option.  You
don't have to do this, but doing so helps Valgrind produce more accurate
and less confusing error reports.  Chances are you're set up like this
already, if you intended to debug your program with GNU GDB, or some
other debugger. Alternatively, the Valgrind option 
<code class="option">--read-inline-info=yes</code> instructs Valgrind to read
the debug information describing inlining information. With this,
function call chain will be properly shown, even when your application
is compiled with inlining. </p>
<p>If you are planning to use Memcheck: On rare
occasions, compiler optimisations (at <code class="option">-O2</code>
and above, and sometimes <code class="option">-O1</code>) have been
observed to generate code which fools Memcheck into wrongly reporting
uninitialised value errors, or missing uninitialised value errors.  We have
looked in detail into fixing this, and unfortunately the result is that
doing so would give a further significant slowdown in what is already a slow
tool.  So the best solution is to turn off optimisation altogether.  Since
this often makes things unmanageably slow, a reasonable compromise is to use
<code class="option">-O</code>.  This gets you the majority of the
benefits of higher optimisation levels whilst keeping relatively small the
chances of false positives or false negatives from Memcheck.  Also, you
should compile your code with <code class="option">-Wall</code> because
it can identify some or all of the problems that Valgrind can miss at the
higher optimisation levels.  (Using <code class="option">-Wall</code>
is also a good idea in general.)  All other tools (as far as we know) are
unaffected by optimisation level, and for profiling tools like Cachegrind it
is better to compile your program at its normal optimisation level.</p>
<p>Valgrind understands the DWARF2/3/4 formats used by GCC 3.1 and
later.  The reader for "stabs" debugging format (used by GCC versions
prior to 3.1) has been disabled in Valgrind 3.9.0.</p>
<p>When you're ready to roll, run Valgrind as described above.
Note that you should run the real
(machine-code) executable here.  If your application is started by, for
example, a shell or Perl script, you'll need to modify it to invoke
Valgrind on the real executables.  Running such scripts directly under
Valgrind will result in you getting error reports pertaining to
<code class="filename">/bin/sh</code>,
<code class="filename">/usr/bin/perl</code>, or whatever interpreter
you're using.  This may not be what you want and can be confusing.  You
can force the issue by giving the option
<code class="option">--trace-children=yes</code>, but confusion is still
likely.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="manual-core.comment"></a>2.3. The Commentary</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Valgrind tools write a commentary, a stream of text, detailing
error reports and other significant events.  All lines in the commentary
have following form:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
==12345== some-message-from-Valgrind</pre>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <code class="computeroutput">12345</code> is the process ID.
This scheme makes it easy to distinguish program output from Valgrind
commentary, and also easy to differentiate commentaries from different
processes which have become merged together, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>By default, Valgrind tools write only essential messages to the
commentary, so as to avoid flooding you with information of secondary
importance.  If you want more information about what is happening,
re-run, passing the <code class="option">-v</code> option to Valgrind.  A second
<code class="option">-v</code> gives yet more detail.
</p>
<p>You can direct the commentary to three different places:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
<li class="listitem">
<p><a name="manual-core.out2fd"></a>The default: send it to a file descriptor, which is by default
    2 (stderr).  So, if you give the core no options, it will write
    commentary to the standard error stream.  If you want to send it to
    some other file descriptor, for example number 9, you can specify
    <code class="option">--log-fd=9</code>.</p>
<p>This is the simplest and most common arrangement, but can
    cause problems when Valgrinding entire trees of processes which
    expect specific file descriptors, particularly stdin/stdout/stderr,
    to be available for their own use.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p><a name="manual-core.out2file"></a>A less intrusive
    option is to write the commentary to a file, which you specify by
    <code class="option">--log-file=filename</code>.  There are special format
    specifiers that can be used to use a process ID or an environment
    variable name in the log file name.  These are useful/necessary if your
    program invokes multiple processes (especially for MPI programs).
    See the <a class="link" href="manual-core.html#manual-core.basicopts" title="2.6.2. Basic Options">basic options section</a>
    for more details.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><a name="manual-core.out2socket"></a>The
    least intrusive option is to send the commentary to a network
    socket.  The socket is specified as an IP address and port number
    pair, like this: <code class="option">--log-socket=192.168.0.1:12345</code> if
    you want to send the output to host IP 192.168.0.1 port 12345
    (note: we
    have no idea if 12345 is a port of pre-existing significance).  You
    can also omit the port number:
    <code class="option">--log-socket=192.168.0.1</code>, in which case a default
    port of 1500 is used.  This default is defined by the constant
    <code class="computeroutput">VG_CLO_DEFAULT_LOGPORT</code> in the
    sources.</p>
<p>Note, unfortunately, that you have to use an IP address here,
    rather than a hostname.</p>
<p>Writing to a network socket is pointless if you don't
    have something listening at the other end.  We provide a simple
    listener program,
    <code class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</code>, which accepts
    connections on the specified port and copies whatever it is sent to
    stdout.  Probably someone will tell us this is a horrible security
    risk.  It seems likely that people will write more sophisticated
    listeners in the fullness of time.</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</code> can accept
    simultaneous connections from up to 50 Valgrinded processes.  In front
    of each line of output it prints the current number of active
    connections in round brackets.</p>
<p><code class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</code> accepts three
    command-line options:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<a name="listener.opts.list"></a><dl class="variablelist">
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-e --exit-at-zero</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>When the number of connected processes falls back to zero,
           exit.  Without this, it will run forever, that is, until you
           send it Control-C.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">--max-connect=INTEGER</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>By default, the listener can connect to up to 50 processes.
             Occasionally, that number is too small. Use this option to
             provide a different limit. E.g.
             <code class="computeroutput">--max-connect=100</code>.
           </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="option">portnumber</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>Changes the port it listens on from the default (1500).
          The specified port must be in the range 1024 to 65535.
          The same restriction applies to port numbers specified by a
          <code class="option">--log-socket</code> to Valgrind itself.</p></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>If a Valgrinded process fails to connect to a listener, for
    whatever reason (the listener isn't running, invalid or unreachable
    host or port, etc), Valgrind switches back to writing the commentary
    to stderr.  The same goes for any process which loses an established
    connection to a listener.  In other words, killing the listener
    doesn't kill the processes sending data to it.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>Here is an important point about the relationship between the
commentary and profiling output from tools.  The commentary contains a
mix of messages from the Valgrind core and the selected tool.  If the
tool reports errors, it will report them to the commentary.  However, if
the tool does profiling, the profile data will be written to a file of
some kind, depending on the tool, and independent of what
<code class="option">--log-*</code> options are in force.  The commentary is
intended to be a low-bandwidth, human-readable channel.  Profiling data,
on the other hand, is usually voluminous and not meaningful without
further processing, which is why we have chosen this arrangement.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="manual-core.report"></a>2.4. Reporting of errors</h2></div></div></div>
<p>When an error-checking tool
detects something bad happening in the program, an error
message is written to the commentary.  Here's an example from Memcheck:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
==25832== Invalid read of size 4
==25832==    at 0x8048724: BandMatrix::ReSize(int, int, int) (bogon.cpp:45)
==25832==    by 0x80487AF: main (bogon.cpp:66)
==25832==  Address 0xBFFFF74C is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd</pre>
<p>This message says that the program did an illegal 4-byte read of
address 0xBFFFF74C, which, as far as Memcheck can tell, is not a valid
stack address, nor corresponds to any current heap blocks or recently freed
heap blocks.  The read is happening at line 45 of
<code class="filename">bogon.cpp</code>, called from line 66 of the same file,
etc.  For errors associated with an identified (current or freed) heap block,
for example reading freed memory, Valgrind reports not only the
location where the error happened, but also where the associated heap block
was allocated/freed.</p>
<p>Valgrind remembers all error reports.  When an error is detected,
it is compared against old reports, to see if it is a duplicate.  If so,
the error is noted, but no further commentary is emitted.  This avoids
you being swamped with bazillions of duplicate error reports.</p>
<p>If you want to know how many times each error occurred, run with
the <code class="option">-v</code> option.  When execution finishes, all the
reports are printed out, along with, and sorted by, their occurrence
counts.  This makes it easy to see which errors have occurred most
frequently.</p>
<p>Errors are reported before the associated operation actually
happens.  For example, if you're using Memcheck and your program attempts to
read from address zero, Memcheck will emit a message to this effect, and
your program will then likely die with a segmentation fault.</p>
<p>In general, you should try and fix errors in the order that they
are reported.  Not doing so can be confusing.  For example, a program
which copies uninitialised values to several memory locations, and later
uses them, will generate several error messages, when run on Memcheck.
The first such error message may well give the most direct clue to the
root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>The process of detecting duplicate errors is quite an
expensive one and can become a significant performance overhead
if your program generates huge quantities of errors.  To avoid
serious problems, Valgrind will simply stop collecting
errors after 1,000 different errors have been seen, or 10,000,000 errors
in total have been seen.  In this situation you might as well
stop your program and fix it, because Valgrind won't tell you
anything else useful after this.  Note that the 1,000/10,000,000 limits
apply after suppressed errors are removed.  These limits are
defined in <code class="filename">m_errormgr.c</code> and can be increased
if necessary.</p>
<p>To avoid this cutoff you can use the
<code class="option">--error-limit=no</code> option.  Then Valgrind will always show
errors, regardless of how many there are.  Use this option carefully,
since it may have a bad effect on performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="manual-core.suppress"></a>2.5. Suppressing errors</h2></div></div></div>
<p>The error-checking tools detect numerous problems in the system
libraries, such as the C library, 
which come pre-installed with your OS.  You can't easily fix
these, but you don't want to see these errors (and yes, there are many!)
So Valgrind reads a list of errors to suppress at startup.  A default
suppression file is created by the
<code class="computeroutput">./configure</code> script when the system is
built.</p>
<p>You can modify and add to the suppressions file at your leisure,
or, better, write your own.  Multiple suppression files are allowed.
This is useful if part of your project contains errors you can't or
don't want to fix, yet you don't want to continuously be reminded of
them.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>By far the easiest way to add
suppressions is to use the <code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> option
described in <a class="xref" href="manual-core.html#manual-core.options" title="2.6. Core Command-line Options">Core Command-line Options</a>.  This generates
suppressions automatically.  For best results,
though, you may want to edit the output
    of  <code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> by hand, in which
case it would be advisable to read through this section.
</p>
<p>Each error to be suppressed is described very specifically, to
minimise the possibility that a suppression-directive inadvertently
suppresses a bunch of similar errors which you did want to see.  The
suppression mechanism is designed to allow precise yet flexible
specification of errors to suppress.</p>
<p>If you use the <code class="option">-v</code> option, at the end of execution,
Valgrind prints out one line for each used suppression, giving the number of times
it got used, its name and the filename and line number where the suppression is
defined. Depending on the suppression kind, the filename and line number are optionally
followed by additional information (such as the number of blocks and bytes suppressed
by a memcheck leak suppression). Here's the suppressions used by a
run of <code class="computeroutput">valgrind -v --tool=memcheck ls -l</code>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
--1610-- used_suppression:      2 dl-hack3-cond-1 /usr/lib/valgrind/default.supp:1234
--1610-- used_suppression:      2 glibc-2.5.x-on-SUSE-10.2-(PPC)-2a /usr/lib/valgrind/default.supp:1234
</pre>
<p>Multiple suppressions files are allowed.  Valgrind loads suppression
patterns from <code class="filename">$PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default.supp</code> unless
<code class="option">--default-suppressions=no</code> has been specified.  You can
ask to add suppressions from additional files by specifying
<code class="option">--suppressions=/path/to/file.supp</code> one or more times.
</p>
<p>If you want to understand more about suppressions, look at an
existing suppressions file whilst reading the following documentation.
The file <code class="filename">glibc-2.3.supp</code>, in the source
distribution, provides some good examples.</p>
<p>Each suppression has the following components:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>First line: its name.  This merely gives a handy name to the
    suppression, by which it is referred to in the summary of used
    suppressions printed out when a program finishes.  It's not
    important what the name is; any identifying string will do.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Second line: name of the tool(s) that the suppression is for
    (if more than one, comma-separated), and the name of the suppression
    itself, separated by a colon (n.b.: no spaces are allowed), eg:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
tool_name1,tool_name2:suppression_name</pre>
<p>Recall that Valgrind is a modular system, in which
    different instrumentation tools can observe your program whilst it
    is running.  Since different tools detect different kinds of errors,
    it is necessary to say which tool(s) the suppression is meaningful
    to.</p>
<p>Tools will complain, at startup, if a tool does not understand
    any suppression directed to it.  Tools ignore suppressions which are
    not directed to them.  As a result, it is quite practical to put
    suppressions for all tools into the same suppression file.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Next line: a small number of suppression types have extra
    information after the second line (eg. the <code class="varname">Param</code>
    suppression for Memcheck)</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Remaining lines: This is the calling context for the error --
    the chain of function calls that led to it.  There can be up to 24
    of these lines.</p>
<p>Locations may be names of either shared objects or
    functions.  They begin
    <code class="computeroutput">obj:</code> and
    <code class="computeroutput">fun:</code> respectively.  Function and
    object names to match against may use the wildcard characters
    <code class="computeroutput">*</code> and

<p><span class="command"><strong>Important note: </strong></span> C++ function names must be
    <span class="command"><strong>mangled</strong></span>.  If you are writing suppressions by
    hand, use the <code class="option">--demangle=no</code> option to get the
    mangled names in your error messages.  An example of a mangled
    C++ name is  <code class="computeroutput">_ZN9QListView4showEv</code>.
    This is the form that the GNU C++ compiler uses internally, and
    the form that must be used in suppression files.  The equivalent

    simply "<code class="computeroutput">...</code>" (three dots).  This is
    a frame-level wildcard, which matches zero or more frames.  Frame
    level wildcards are useful because they make it easy to ignore
    varying numbers of uninteresting frames in between frames of
    interest.  That is often important when writing suppressions which
    are intended to be robust against variations in the amount of
    function inlining done by compilers.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Finally, the entire suppression must be between curly
    braces. Each brace must be the first character on its own
    line.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>A suppression only suppresses an error when the error matches all
the details in the suppression.  Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
{
  __gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc
  Memcheck:Value4
  fun:__gconv_transform_ascii_internal
  fun:__mbr*toc
  fun:mbtowc
}</pre>
<p>What it means is: for Memcheck only, suppress a
use-of-uninitialised-value error, when the data size is 4, when it
occurs in the function
<code class="computeroutput">__gconv_transform_ascii_internal</code>, when
that is called from any function of name matching
<code class="computeroutput">__mbr*toc</code>, when that is called from
<code class="computeroutput">mbtowc</code>.  It doesn't apply under any
other circumstances.  The string by which this suppression is identified
to the user is
<code class="computeroutput">__gconv_transform_ascii_internal/__mbrtowc/mbtowc</code>.</p>
<p>(See <a class="xref" href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.suppfiles" title="4.4. Writing suppression files">Writing suppression files</a> for more details
on the specifics of Memcheck's suppression kinds.)</p>
<p>Another example, again for the Memcheck tool:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
{
  libX11.so.6.2/libX11.so.6.2/libXaw.so.7.0
  Memcheck:Value4
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.2
  obj:/usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.so.7.0
}</pre>
<p>This suppresses any size 4 uninitialised-value error which occurs
anywhere in <code class="filename">libX11.so.6.2</code>, when called from
anywhere in the same library, when called from anywhere in
<code class="filename">libXaw.so.7.0</code>.  The inexact specification of
locations is regrettable, but is about all you can hope for, given that
the X11 libraries shipped on the Linux distro on which this example
was made have had their symbol tables removed.</p>
<p>Although the above two examples do not make this clear, you can
freely mix <code class="computeroutput">obj:</code> and
<code class="computeroutput">fun:</code> lines in a suppression.</p>
<p>Finally, here's an example using three frame-level wildcards:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
{
   a-contrived-example
   Memcheck:Leak
   fun:malloc
   ...
   fun:ddd
   ...
   fun:ccc
   ...
   fun:main
}
</pre>
This suppresses Memcheck memory-leak errors, in the case where
the allocation was done by <code class="computeroutput">main</code>
calling (though any number of intermediaries, including zero)
<code class="computeroutput">ccc</code>,
calling onwards via
<code class="computeroutput">ddd</code> and eventually
to <code class="computeroutput">malloc.</code>.

<p>Note that Valgrind does trace into the child of a

      <code class="varname">fork</code> makes an identical copy of a process), so this
      option is arguably badly named.  However, most children of

<p>
        This can be useful for pruning uninteresting branches from a
        tree of processes being run on Valgrind.  But you should be
        careful when using it.  When Valgrind skips tracing into an
        executable, it doesn't just skip tracing that executable, it
        also skips tracing any of that executable's child processes.
        In other words, the flag doesn't merely cause tracing to stop
        at the specified executables -- it skips tracing of entire
        process subtrees rooted at any of the specified

      WARNING: If you use <code class="option">--trace-children=yes</code> and your

      (or the <code class="option">%q</code> specifier below), the Valgrind output from

      possibly incomplete.</p>
<p><code class="option">%q{FOO}</code> is replaced with the contents of the
      environment variable <code class="varname">FOO</code>.  If the
      <code class="option">{FOO}</code> part is malformed, it causes an abort.  This
      specifier is rarely needed, but very useful in certain circumstances
      (eg. when running MPI programs).  The idea is that you specify a
      variable which will be set differently for each process in the job,
      for example <code class="computeroutput">BPROC_RANK</code> or whatever is
      applicable in your MPI setup.  If the named environment variable is not
      set, it causes an abort.  Note that in some shells, the
      <code class="option">{</code> and <code class="option">}</code> characters may need to be
      escaped with a backslash.</p>
<p><code class="option">%%</code> is replaced with <code class="option">%</code>.</p>
<p>If an <code class="option">%</code> is followed by any other character, it

<p>If the file name specifies a relative file name, it is put

      directory when the program started its execution after the fork

<p>The recommended options for a GUI to pass, when requesting

      <code class="option">--xml-file</code> to send the XML output to a (presumably

      <code class="option">--child-silent-after-fork=yes</code>, and
      <code class="option">-q</code> to restrict the plain text output to critical
      error messages created by Valgrind itself.  For example, failure to
      read a specified suppressions file counts as a critical error message.
      In this way, for a successful run the text output file will be empty.
      But if it isn't empty, then it will contain important information

<p>An important fact about demangling is that function names

      Valgrind does not demangle function names when searching for

<p>Stack-scanning support is available only on ARM
      targets.</p>
<p>These flags enable and control stack unwinding by stack
      scanning.  When the normal stack unwinding mechanisms -- usage
      of Dwarf CFI records, and frame-pointer following -- fail, stack
      scanning may be able to recover a stack trace.</p>
<p>Note that stack scanning is an imprecise, heuristic
      mechanism that may give very misleading results, or none at all.
      It should be used only in emergencies, when normal unwinding
      fails, and it is important to nevertheless have stack
      traces.</p>
<p>Stack scanning is a simple technique: the unwinder reads
      words from the stack, and tries to guess which of them might be
      return addresses, by checking to see if they point just after
      ARM or Thumb call instructions.  If so, the word is added to the
      backtrace.</p>
<p>The main danger occurs when a function call returns,
      leaving its return address exposed, and a new function is
      called, but the new function does not overwrite the old address.
      The result of this is that the backtrace may contain entries for
      functions which have already returned, and so be very
      confusing.</p>
<p>A second limitation of this implementation is that it will
      scan only the page (4KB, normally) containing the starting stack
      pointer.  If the stack frames are large, this may result in only
      a few (or not even any) being present in the trace.  Also, if
      you are unlucky and have an initial stack pointer near the end
      of its containing page, the scan may miss all interesting
      frames.</p>
<p>By default stack scanning is disabled.  The normal use
      case is to ask for it when a stack trace would otherwise be very
      short.  So, to enable it,
      use <code class="computeroutput">--unw-stack-scan-thresh=number</code>.
      This requests Valgrind to try using stack scanning to "extend"
      stack traces which contain fewer
      than <code class="computeroutput">number</code> frames.</p>
<p>If stack scanning does take place, it will only generate
      at most the number of frames specified
      by <code class="computeroutput">--unw-stack-scan-frames</code>.
      Typically, stack scanning generates so many garbage entries that
      this value is set to a low value (5) by default.  In no case
      will a stack trace larger than the value specified
      by <code class="computeroutput">--num-callers</code> be
      created.</p>

<dd>
<p>By default Valgrind only shows the filenames in stack
      traces, but not full paths to source files.  When using Valgrind
      in large projects where the sources reside in multiple different
      directories, this can be inconvenient.
      <code class="option">--fullpath-after</code> provides a flexible solution
      to this problem.  When this option is present, the path to each
      source file is shown, with the following all-important caveat:
      if <code class="option">string</code> is found in the path, then the path
      up to and including <code class="option">string</code> is omitted, else the
      path is shown unmodified.  Note that <code class="option">string</code> is
      not required to be a prefix of the path.</p>
<p>For example, consider a file named
      <code class="computeroutput">/home/janedoe/blah/src/foo/bar/xyzzy.c</code>.
      Specifying <code class="option">--fullpath-after=/home/janedoe/blah/src/</code>
      will cause Valgrind to show the name
      as <code class="computeroutput">foo/bar/xyzzy.c</code>.</p>
<p>Because the string is not required to be a prefix,
      <code class="option">--fullpath-after=src/</code> will produce the same
      output.  This is useful when the path contains arbitrary
      machine-generated characters.  For example, the
      path
      <code class="computeroutput">/my/build/dir/C32A1B47/blah/src/foo/xyzzy</code>
      can be pruned to <code class="computeroutput">foo/xyzzy</code>
      using
      <code class="option">--fullpath-after=/blah/src/</code>.</p>
<p>If you simply want to see the full path, just specify an
      empty string: <code class="option">--fullpath-after=</code>.  This isn't a
      special case, merely a logical consequence of the above rules.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use <code class="option">--fullpath-after</code>
      multiple times.  Any appearance of it causes Valgrind to switch
      to producing full paths and applying the above filtering rule.
      Each produced path is compared against all
      the <code class="option">--fullpath-after</code>-specified strings, in the
      order specified.  The first string to match causes the path to
      be truncated as described above.  If none match, the full path
      is shown.  This facilitates chopping off prefixes when the
      sources are drawn from a number of unrelated directories.

<p>By default Valgrind searches in several well-known paths

<p>However, there may be scenarios where you may wish to put
      debug objects at an arbitrary location, such as external storage
      when running Valgrind on a mobile device with limited local
      storage.  Another example might be a situation where you do not
      have permission to install debug object packages on the system
      where you are running Valgrind.</p>
<p>In these scenarios, you may provide an absolute path as an extra,
      final place for Valgrind to search for debug objects by specifying
      <code class="option">--extra-debuginfo-path=/path/to/debug/objects</code>.
      The given path will be prepended to the absolute path name of

      for <code class="computeroutput">/w/x/y/zz.so</code>
      and <code class="option">--extra-debuginfo-path=/a/b/c</code> is specified,

<p>This is a new, experimental, feature introduced in version
      3.9.0.</p>
<p>In some scenarios it may be convenient to read debuginfo
      from objects stored on a different machine.  With this flag,
      Valgrind will query a debuginfo server running
      on <code class="computeroutput">ipaddr</code> and listening on
      port <code class="computeroutput">port</code>, if it cannot find
      the debuginfo object in the local filesystem.</p>
<p>The debuginfo server must accept TCP connections on
      port <code class="computeroutput">port</code>.  The debuginfo
      server is contained in the source
      file <code class="computeroutput">auxprogs/valgrind-di-server.c</code>.
      It will only serve from the directory it is started
      in.  <code class="computeroutput">port</code> defaults to 1500 in
      both client and server if not specified.</p>
<p>If Valgrind looks for the debuginfo for
      <code class="computeroutput">/w/x/y/zz.so</code> by using the
      debuginfo server, it will strip the pathname components and
      merely request <code class="computeroutput">zz.so</code> on the
      server.  That in turn will look only in its current working
      directory for a matching debuginfo object.</p>
<p>The debuginfo data is transmitted in small fragments (8
      KB) as requested by Valgrind.  Each block is compressed using
      LZO to reduce transmission time.  The implementation has been
      tuned for best performance over a single-stage 802.11g (WiFi)
      network link.</p>
<p>Note that checks for matching primary vs debug objects,
      using GNU debuglink CRC scheme, are performed even when using
      the debuginfo server.  To disable such checking, you need to
      also specify
      <code class="computeroutput">--allow-mismatched-debuginfo=yes</code>.
      </p>
<p>By default the Valgrind build system will
      build <code class="computeroutput">valgrind-di-server</code> for
      the target platform, which is almost certainly not what you
      want.  So far we have been unable to find out how to get
      automake/autoconf to build it for the build platform.  If
      you want to use it, you will have to recompile it by hand using
      the command shown at the top
      of <code class="computeroutput">auxprogs/valgrind-di-server.c</code>.</p>

<p>When reading debuginfo from separate debuginfo objects,
      Valgrind will by default check that the main and debuginfo

      debuginfo objects, and also ensures that Valgrind can't crash as
      a result of mismatches.</p>
<p>This check can be overridden using 
      <code class="computeroutput">--allow-mismatched-debuginfo=yes</code>.
      This may be useful when the debuginfo and main objects have not
      been split in the proper way.  Be careful when using this,
      though: it disables all consistency checking, and Valgrind has
      been observed to crash when the main and debuginfo objects don't

<p>When set to <code class="varname">all</code>, Valgrind will print a

<p>This option is particularly useful with C++ programs, as it
      prints out the suppressions with mangled names, as
      required.</p>
<p>Note that the suppressions printed are as specific as
      possible.  You may want to common up similar ones, by adding
      wildcards to function names, and by using frame-level wildcards.
      The wildcarding facilities are powerful yet flexible, and with a
      bit of careful editing, you may be able to suppress a whole
      family of related errors with only a few suppressions.

      Instead, the debuginfo must be linked manually by

<p>With <code class="option">--dsymutil=yes</code>, Valgrind
      will, in such cases, automatically

<p>The maximum size of a stack frame.  If the stack pointer moves by

<p>You may need to use this option if your program has large
      stack-allocated arrays.  Valgrind keeps track of your program's
      stack pointer.  If it changes by more than the threshold amount,
      Valgrind assumes your program is switching to a different stack,
      and Memcheck behaves differently than it would for a stack pointer
      change smaller than the threshold.  Usually this heuristic works
      well.  However, if your program allocates large structures on the
      stack, this heuristic will be fooled, and Memcheck will
      subsequently report large numbers of invalid stack accesses.  This
      option allows you to change the threshold to a different
      value.</p>
<p>You should only consider use of this option if Valgrind's
      debug output directs you to do so.  In that case it will tell you
      the new threshold you should specify.</p>
<p>In general, allocating large structures on the stack is a
      bad idea, because you can easily run out of stack space,
      especially on systems with limited memory or which expect to
      support large numbers of threads each with a small stack, and also
      because the error checking performed by Memcheck is more effective
      for heap-allocated data than for stack-allocated data.  If you
      have to use this option, you may wish to consider rewriting your

      this gives a stack size in the range 8 to 16 MB, which almost
      never overflows for most applications.</p>
<p>If you need a larger total stack size,
      use <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> to specify it.  Only set

      need (that is, hundreds of megabytes more than you need)

<p>On Linux, you may request a stack of size up to 2GB.
      Valgrind will stop with a diagnostic message if the stack cannot
      be allocated.</p>
<p><code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> only affects the stack
      size for the program's initial thread.  It has no bearing on the
      size of thread stacks, as Valgrind does not allocate
      those.</p>
<p>You may need to use both <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code>
      and <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code> together.  It is important
      to understand that <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> sets the
      maximum total stack size,
      whilst <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code> specifies the largest
      size of any one stack frame.  You will have to work out
      the <code class="option">--main-stacksize</code> value for yourself
      (usually, if your applications segfaults).  But Valgrind will
      tell you the needed <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code> size, if
      necessary.</p>
<p>As discussed further in the description
      of <code class="option">--max-stackframe</code>, a requirement for a large
      stack is a sign of potential portability problems.  You are best
      advised to place all large data in heap-allocated memory.</p>

<p> Valgrind's <code class="function">malloc, realloc,</code> etc, add
      padding blocks before and after each heap block allocated by the
      program being run. Such padding blocks are called redzones.  The
      default value for the redzone size depends on the tool.  For
      example, Memcheck adds and protects a minimum of 16 bytes before
      and after each block allocated by the client.  This allows it to
      detect block underruns or overruns of up to 16 bytes.

<p>Increasing the redzone size makes it possible to detect

<dd>
<p>This option controls Valgrind's detection of self-modifying
       code.  If no checking is done, when a program executes some code, then
       overwrites it with new code, and executes the new code, Valgrind will
       continue to execute the translations it made for the old code.  This
       will likely lead to incorrect behaviour and/or crashes.</p>
<p>For "modern" architectures -- anything that's not x86,
        amd64 or s390x -- the default is <code class="varname">stack</code>.
        This is because a correct program must take explicit action
        to reestablish D-I cache coherence following code
        modification.  Valgrind observes and honours such actions,
        with the result that self-modifying code is transparently
        handled with zero extra cost.</p>
<p>For x86, amd64 and s390x, the program is not required to
        notify the hardware of required D-I coherence syncing.  Hence
        the default is <code class="varname">all-non-file</code>, which covers
        the normal case of generating code into an anonymous
        (non-file-backed) mmap'd area.</p>
<p>The meanings of the four available settings are as
        follows.  No detection (<code class="varname">none</code>),
        detect self-modifying code
        on the stack (which is used by GCC to implement nested
        functions) (<code class="varname">stack</code>), detect self-modifying code
        everywhere (<code class="varname">all</code>), and detect
        self-modifying code everywhere except in file-backed
        mappings (<code class="varname">all-non-file</code>).</p>
<p>Running with <code class="varname">all</code> will slow Valgrind
        down noticeably.  Running with <code class="varname">none</code> will
        rarely speed things up, since very little code gets
        dynamically generated in most programs.  The
        <code class="function">VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS</code> client
        request is an alternative to <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>
        and <code class="option">--smc-check=all-non-file</code>
        that requires more programmer effort but allows Valgrind to run
        your program faster, by telling it precisely when translations
        need to be re-made.
        
        </p>
<p><code class="option">--smc-check=all-non-file</code> provides a
       cheaper but more limited version
       of <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>.  It adds checks to any
       translations that do not originate from file-backed memory
       mappings.  Typical applications that generate code, for example
       JITs in web browsers, generate code into anonymous mmaped areas,
       whereas the "fixed" code of the browser always lives in
       file-backed mappings.  <code class="option">--smc-check=all-non-file</code>
       takes advantage of this observation, limiting the overhead of
       checking to code which is likely to be JIT generated.</p>

<p>This option is only relevant when running Valgrind on Linux.</p>
<p>The GNU C library (<code class="function">libc.so</code>), which is
      used by all programs, may allocate memory for its own uses.
      Usually it doesn't bother to free that memory when the program
      ends&#8212;there would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims
      all process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would
      just slow things down.</p>
<p>The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes leak
      checkers, such as Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in glibc, when
      a leak check is done at exit.  In order to avoid this, they
      provided a routine called <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code>
      specifically to make glibc release all memory it has allocated.
      Memcheck therefore tries to run
      <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code> at exit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in some very old versions of glibc,
      <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code> is sufficiently buggy to cause
      segmentation faults.  This was particularly noticeable on Red Hat
      7.1.  So this option is provided in order to inhibit the run of
      <code class="function">__libc_freeres</code>.  If your program seems to run
      fine on Valgrind, but segfaults at exit, you may find that
      <code class="option">--run-libc-freeres=no</code> fixes that, although at the

<li class="listitem">
<p><code class="option">no-nptl-pthread-stackcache: </code>
            This hint is only relevant when running Valgrind on Linux.</p>
<p>The GNU glibc pthread library
            (<code class="function">libpthread.so</code>), which is used by
            pthread programs, maintains a cache of pthread stacks.
            When a pthread terminates, the memory used for the pthread
            stack and some thread local storage related data structure
            are not always directly released.  This memory is kept in
            a cache (up to a certain size), and is re-used if a new
            thread is started.</p>
<p>This cache causes the helgrind tool to report some
            false positive race condition errors on this cached
            memory, as helgrind does not understand the internal glibc
            cache synchronisation primitives. So, when using helgrind,
            disabling the cache helps to avoid false positive race
            conditions, in particular when using thread local storage
            variables (e.g. variables using the
            <code class="function">__thread</code> qualifier).</p>
<p>When using the memcheck tool, disabling the cache
            ensures the memory used by glibc to handle __thread
            variables is directly released when a thread
            terminates.</p>
<p>Note: Valgrind disables the cache using some internal
            knowledge of the glibc stack cache implementation and by
            examining the debug information of the pthread
            library. This technique is thus somewhat fragile and might
            not work for all glibc versions. This has been succesfully
            tested with various glibc versions (e.g. 2.11, 2.16, 2.18)

<p>Some recursive algorithms, for example balanced binary
      tree implementations, create many different stack traces, each
      containing cycles of calls.  A cycle is defined as two identical
      program counter values separated by zero or more other program
      counter values.  Valgrind may then use a lot of memory to store
      all these stack traces.  This is a poor use of memory
      considering that such stack traces contain repeated
      uninteresting recursive calls instead of more interesting
      information such as the function that has initiated the
      recursive call.
      </p>
<p>The option <code class="option">--merge-recursive-frames=&lt;number&gt;</code>
      instructs Valgrind to detect and merge recursive call cycles
      having a size of up to <code class="option">&lt;number&gt;</code>
      frames. When such a cycle is detected, Valgrind records the
      cycle in the stack trace as a unique program counter.
      </p>
<p>
      The value 0 (the default) causes no recursive call merging.
      A value of 1 will cause stack traces of simple recursive algorithms
      (for example, a factorial implementation) to be collapsed.
      A value of 2 will usually be needed to collapse stack traces produced
      by recursive algorithms such as binary trees, quick sort, etc.
      Higher values might be needed for more complex recursive algorithms.

      confusing to load the wrong, un-annotated

      is: add a text symbol in the marked-up library, for

      give the flag
      <code class="varname">--require-text-symbol=:*libgomp*so*:annotated_for_helgrind_3_6</code>
      so that when <code class="varname">libgomp.so</code> is loaded, Valgrind
      scans its symbol table, and if the symbol isn't present the run
      is aborted, rather than continuing silently with the
      un-marked-up library.  Note that you should put the entire flag
      in quotes to stop shells expanding up the <code class="varname">*</code>
      and <code class="varname">?</code> wildcards.

<p>When a shared library is loaded, Valgrind checks for 
      functions in the library that must be replaced or wrapped.
      For example, Memcheck replaces all malloc related
      functions (malloc, free, calloc, ...) with its own versions.
      Such replacements are done by default only in shared libraries whose
      soname matches a predefined soname pattern (e.g.
      <code class="varname">libc.so*</code> on linux).
      By default, no replacement is done for a statically linked
      library or for alternative libraries such as tcmalloc.
      In some cases, the replacements allow
      <code class="option">--soname-synonyms</code> to specify one additional
      synonym pattern, giving flexibility in the replacement. </p>
<p>Currently, this flexibility is only allowed for the
      malloc related functions, using the
      synonym <code class="varname">somalloc</code>.  This synonym is usable for
      all tools doing standard replacement of malloc related functions
      (e.g. memcheck, massif, drd, helgrind, exp-dhat, exp-sgcheck).

<a name="manual-core.pthreads"></a>2.7. Support for Threads</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Threaded programs are fully supported.</p>
<p>The main thing to point out with respect to threaded programs is
that your program will use the native threading library, but Valgrind
serialises execution so that only one (kernel) thread is running at a
time.  This approach avoids the horrible implementation problems of
implementing a truly multithreaded version of Valgrind, but it does
mean that threaded apps never use more than one CPU simultaneously,
even if you have a multiprocessor or multicore machine.</p>
<p>Valgrind doesn't schedule the threads itself.  It merely ensures
that only one thread runs at once, using a simple locking scheme.  The
actual thread scheduling remains under control of the OS kernel.  What
this does mean, though, is that your program will see very different
scheduling when run on Valgrind than it does when running normally.
This is both because Valgrind is serialising the threads, and because
the code runs so much slower than normal.</p>
<p>This difference in scheduling may cause your program to behave
differently, if you have some kind of concurrency, critical race,
locking, or similar, bugs.  In that case you might consider using the
tools Helgrind and/or DRD to track them down.</p>
<p>On Linux, Valgrind also supports direct use of the
<code class="computeroutput">clone</code> system call,
<code class="computeroutput">futex</code> and so on.
<code class="computeroutput">clone</code> is supported where either
everything is shared (a thread) or nothing is shared (fork-like); partial
sharing will fail.
</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="manual-core.pthreads_perf_sched"></a>2.7.1. Scheduling and Multi-Thread Performance</h3></div></div></div>
<p>A thread executes code only when it holds the abovementioned
lock.  After executing some number of instructions, the running thread
will release the lock.  All threads ready to run will then compete to
acquire the lock.</p>
<p>The <code class="option">--fair-sched</code> option controls the locking mechanism
used to serialise thread execution.</p>
<p>The default pipe based locking mechanism
(<code class="option">--fair-sched=no</code>) is available on all
platforms.  Pipe based locking does not guarantee fairness between
threads: it is quite likely that a thread that has just released the
lock reacquires it immediately, even though other threads are ready to
run.  When using pipe based locking, different runs of the same
multithreaded application might give very different thread
scheduling.</p>
<p>An alternative locking mechanism, based on futexes, is available
on some platforms.  If available, it is activated
by <code class="option">--fair-sched=yes</code> or
<code class="option">--fair-sched=try</code>.  Futex based locking ensures
fairness (round-robin scheduling) between threads: if multiple threads
are ready to run, the lock will be given to the thread which first
requested the lock.  Note that a thread which is blocked in a system
call (e.g. in a blocking read system call) has not (yet) requested the
lock: such a thread requests the lock only after the system call is
finished.</p>
<p> The fairness of the futex based locking produces better
reproducibility of thread scheduling for different executions of a
multithreaded application. This better reproducibility is particularly
helpful when using Helgrind or DRD.</p>
<p>Valgrind's use of thread serialisation implies that only one
thread at a time may run.  On a multiprocessor/multicore system, the
running thread is assigned to one of the CPUs by the OS kernel
scheduler.  When a thread acquires the lock, sometimes the thread will
be assigned to the same CPU as the thread that just released the
lock.  Sometimes, the thread will be assigned to another CPU.  When
using pipe based locking, the thread that just acquired the lock
will usually be scheduled on the same CPU as the thread that just
released the lock.  With the futex based mechanism, the thread that
just acquired the lock will more often be scheduled on another
CPU.</p>
<p>Valgrind's thread serialisation and CPU assignment by the OS
kernel scheduler can interact badly with the CPU frequency scaling
available on many modern CPUs.  To decrease power consumption, the
frequency of a CPU or core is automatically decreased if the CPU/core
has not been used recently.  If the OS kernel often assigns the thread
which just acquired the lock to another CPU/core, it is quite likely
that this CPU/core is currently at a low frequency.  The frequency of
this CPU will be increased after some time.  However, during this
time, the (only) running thread will have run at the low frequency.
Once this thread has run for some time, it will release the lock.
Another thread will acquire this lock, and might be scheduled again on
another CPU whose clock frequency was decreased in the
meantime.</p>
<p>The futex based locking causes threads to change CPUs/cores more
often.  So, if CPU frequency scaling is activated, the futex based
locking might decrease significantly the performance of a
multithreaded app running under Valgrind.  Performance losses of up to
50% degradation have been observed, as compared to running on a
machine for which CPU frequency scaling has been disabled.  The pipe
based locking locking scheme also interacts badly with CPU frequency
scaling, with performance losses in the range 10..20% having been
observed.</p>
<p>To avoid such performance degradation, you should indicate to
the kernel that all CPUs/cores should always run at maximum clock
speed.  Depending on your Linux distribution, CPU frequency scaling
may be controlled using a graphical interface or using command line
such as
<code class="computeroutput">cpufreq-selector</code> or
<code class="computeroutput">cpufreq-set</code>.
</p>
<p>An alternative way to avoid these problems is to tell the
OS scheduler to tie a Valgrind process to a specific (fixed) CPU using the
<code class="computeroutput">taskset</code> command.  This should ensure
that the selected CPU does not fall below its maximum frequency
setting so long as any thread of the program has work to do.

<p>If you're using signals in clever ways (for example, catching
SIGSEGV, modifying page state and restarting the instruction), you're

or <code class="option">--vex-iropt-register-updates=allregs-at-each-insn</code>.
</p>
<p>If your program dies as a result of a fatal core-dumping signal,
Valgrind will generate its own core file
(<code class="computeroutput">vgcore.NNNNN</code>) containing your program's
state.  You may use this core file for post-mortem debugging with GDB or
similar.  (Note: it will not generate a core if your core dump size limit is
0.)  At the time of writing the core dumps do not include all the floating
point register information.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Valgrind itself crashes, the operating system
will create a core dump in the usual way.</p>

<p>If you get an assertion failure
in <code class="filename">m_mallocfree.c</code>, this may have happened because
your program wrote off the end of a heap block, or before its
beginning, thus corrupting heap metadata.  Valgrind hopefully will have
emitted a message to that effect before dying in this way.</p>

<a name="manual-core.limits"></a>2.11. Limitations</h2></div></div></div>
<p>The following list of limitations seems long.  However, most
programs actually work fine.</p>
<p>Valgrind will run programs on the supported platforms
subject to the following constraints:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>On x86 and amd64, there is no support for 3DNow!
   instructions.  If the translator encounters these, Valgrind will
   generate a SIGILL when the instruction is executed.  Apart from
   that, on x86 and amd64, essentially all instructions are supported,
   up to and including AVX and AES in 64-bit mode and SSSE3 in 32-bit
   mode.  32-bit mode does in fact support the bare minimum SSE4
   instructions needed to run programs on MacOSX 10.6 on 32-bit
   targets.
   </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>On ppc32 and ppc64, almost all integer, floating point and
   Altivec instructions are supported.  Specifically: integer and FP
   insns that are mandatory for PowerPC, the "General-purpose
   optional" group (fsqrt, fsqrts, stfiwx), the "Graphics optional"
   group (fre, fres, frsqrte, frsqrtes), and the Altivec (also known
   as VMX) SIMD instruction set, are supported.  Also, instructions
   from the Power ISA 2.05 specification, as present in POWER6 CPUs,
   are supported.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>On ARM, essentially the entire ARMv7-A instruction set
    is supported, in both ARM and Thumb mode.  ThumbEE and Jazelle are
    not supported.  NEON, VFPv3 and ARMv6 media support is fairly
    complete.
   </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>If your program does its own memory management, rather than
   using malloc/new/free/delete, it should still work, but Memcheck's
   error checking won't be so effective.  If you describe your
   program's memory management scheme using "client requests" (see
   <a class="xref" href="manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.clientreq" title="3.1. The Client Request mechanism">The Client Request mechanism</a>), Memcheck can do
   better.  Nevertheless, using malloc/new and free/delete is still
   the best approach.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Valgrind's signal simulation is not as robust as it could be.
   Basic POSIX-compliant sigaction and sigprocmask functionality is
   supplied, but it's conceivable that things could go badly awry if you
   do weird things with signals.  Workaround: don't.  Programs that do
   non-POSIX signal tricks are in any case inherently unportable, so
   should be avoided if possible.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Machine instructions, and system calls, have been implemented
   on demand.  So it's possible, although unlikely, that a program will
   fall over with a message to that effect.  If this happens, please
   report all the details printed out, so we can try and implement the
   missing feature.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Memory consumption of your program is majorly increased
   whilst running under Valgrind's Memcheck tool.  This is due to the
   large amount of administrative information maintained behind the
   scenes.  Another cause is that Valgrind dynamically translates the
   original executable.  Translated, instrumented code is 12-18 times
   larger than the original so you can easily end up with 150+ MB of
   translations when running (eg) a web browser.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Valgrind can handle dynamically-generated code just fine.  If
   you regenerate code over the top of old code (ie. at the same
   memory addresses), if the code is on the stack Valgrind will
   realise the code has changed, and work correctly.  This is
   necessary to handle the trampolines GCC uses to implemented nested
   functions.  If you regenerate code somewhere other than the stack,
   and you are running on an 32- or 64-bit x86 CPU, you will need to
   use the <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code> option, and Valgrind will
   run more slowly than normal.  Or you can add client requests that
   tell Valgrind when your program has overwritten code.
   </p>
<p> On other platforms (ARM, PowerPC) Valgrind observes and
   honours the cache invalidation hints that programs are obliged to
   emit to notify new code, and so self-modifying-code support should
   work automatically, without the need
   for <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Valgrind has the following limitations
   in its implementation of x86/AMD64 floating point relative to 
   IEEE754.</p>
<p>Precision: There is no support for 80 bit arithmetic.
   Internally, Valgrind represents all such "long double" numbers in 64
   bits, and so there may be some differences in results.  Whether or
   not this is critical remains to be seen.  Note, the x86/amd64
   fldt/fstpt instructions (read/write 80-bit numbers) are correctly
   simulated, using conversions to/from 64 bits, so that in-memory
   images of 80-bit numbers look correct if anyone wants to see.</p>
<p>The impression observed from many FP regression tests is that
   the accuracy differences aren't significant.  Generally speaking, if
   a program relies on 80-bit precision, there may be difficulties
   porting it to non x86/amd64 platforms which only support 64-bit FP
   precision.  Even on x86/amd64, the program may get different results
   depending on whether it is compiled to use SSE2 instructions (64-bits
   only), or x87 instructions (80-bit).  The net effect is to make FP
   programs behave as if they had been run on a machine with 64-bit IEEE
   floats, for example PowerPC.  On amd64 FP arithmetic is done by
   default on SSE2, so amd64 looks more like PowerPC than x86 from an FP
   perspective, and there are far fewer noticeable accuracy differences
   than with x86.</p>
<p>Rounding: Valgrind does observe the 4 IEEE-mandated rounding
   modes (to nearest, to +infinity, to -infinity, to zero) for the
   following conversions: float to integer, integer to float where
   there is a possibility of loss of precision, and float-to-float
   rounding.  For all other FP operations, only the IEEE default mode
   (round to nearest) is supported.</p>
<p>Numeric exceptions in FP code: IEEE754 defines five types of
   numeric exception that can happen: invalid operation (sqrt of
   negative number, etc), division by zero, overflow, underflow,
   inexact (loss of precision).</p>
<p>For each exception, two courses of action are defined by IEEE754:
   either (1) a user-defined exception handler may be called, or (2) a
   default action is defined, which "fixes things up" and allows the
   computation to proceed without throwing an exception.</p>
<p>Currently Valgrind only supports the default fixup actions.
   Again, feedback on the importance of exception support would be
   appreciated.</p>
<p>When Valgrind detects that the program is trying to exceed any
   of these limitations (setting exception handlers, rounding mode, or
   precision control), it can print a message giving a traceback of
   where this has happened, and continue execution.  This behaviour used
   to be the default, but the messages are annoying and so showing them
   is now disabled by default.  Use <code class="option">--show-emwarns=yes</code> to see
   them.</p>
<p>The above limitations define precisely the IEEE754 'default'
   behaviour: default fixup on all exceptions, round-to-nearest
   operations, and 64-bit precision.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Valgrind has the following limitations in
   its implementation of x86/AMD64 SSE2 FP arithmetic, relative to 
   IEEE754.</p>
<p>Essentially the same: no exceptions, and limited observance of
   rounding mode.  Also, SSE2 has control bits which make it treat
   denormalised numbers as zero (DAZ) and a related action, flush
   denormals to zero (FTZ).  Both of these cause SSE2 arithmetic to be
   less accurate than IEEE requires.  Valgrind detects, ignores, and can
   warn about, attempts to enable either mode.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Valgrind has the following limitations in
   its implementation of ARM VFPv3 arithmetic, relative to 
   IEEE754.</p>
<p>Essentially the same: no exceptions, and limited observance
   of rounding mode.  Also, switching the VFP unit into vector mode
   will cause Valgrind to abort the program -- it has no way to
   emulate vector uses of VFP at a reasonable performance level.  This
   is no big deal given that non-scalar uses of VFP instructions are
   in any case deprecated.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Valgrind has the following limitations
   in its implementation of PPC32 and PPC64 floating point 
   arithmetic, relative to IEEE754.</p>
<p>Scalar (non-Altivec): Valgrind provides a bit-exact emulation of
   all floating point instructions, except for "fre" and "fres", which are
   done more precisely than required by the PowerPC architecture specification.
   All floating point operations observe the current rounding mode.
   </p>
<p>However, fpscr[FPRF] is not set after each operation.  That could
   be done but would give measurable performance overheads, and so far
   no need for it has been found.</p>
<p>As on x86/AMD64, IEEE754 exceptions are not supported: all floating
   point exceptions are handled using the default IEEE fixup actions.
   Valgrind detects, ignores, and can warn about, attempts to unmask 
   the 5 IEEE FP exception kinds by writing to the floating-point status 
   and control register (fpscr).
   </p>
<p>Vector (Altivec, VMX): essentially as with x86/AMD64 SSE/SSE2: 
   no exceptions, and limited observance of rounding mode.  
   For Altivec, FP arithmetic
   is done in IEEE/Java mode, which is more accurate than the Linux default
   setting.  "More accurate" means that denormals are handled properly, 
   rather than simply being flushed to zero.</p>

    errors will still be recorded, but in less detail than
    before.</code></p>
<p>After 100 different errors have been shown, Valgrind becomes
    more conservative about collecting them.  It then requires only the
    program counters in the top two stack frames to match when deciding
    whether or not two errors are really the same one.  Prior to this
    point, the PCs in the top four frames are required to match.  This
    hack has the effect of slowing down the appearance of new errors
    after the first 100.  The 100 constant can be changed by recompiling
    Valgrind.</p>

<li class="listitem">
<p><code class="computeroutput">More than 1000 errors detected.  I'm not
    reporting any more.  Final error counts may be inaccurate.  Go fix
    your program!</code></p>
<p>After 1000 different errors have been detected, Valgrind
    ignores any more.  It seems unlikely that collecting even more
    different ones would be of practical help to anybody, and it avoids
    the danger that Valgrind spends more and more of its time comparing
    new errors against an ever-growing collection.  As above, the 1000

<li class="listitem">
<p><code class="computeroutput">Warning: client switching stacks?</code></p>
<p>Valgrind spotted such a large change in the stack pointer
    that it guesses the client is switching to a different stack.  At
    this point it makes a kludgey guess where the base of the new
    stack is, and sets memory permissions accordingly.  At the moment
    "large change" is defined as a change of more that 2000000 in the
    value of the stack pointer register.  If Valgrind guesses wrong,
    you may get many bogus error messages following this and/or have
    crashes in the stack trace recording code.  You might avoid these
    problems by informing Valgrind about the stack bounds using
    VALGRIND_STACK_REGISTER client request. </p>

    If you see this message, you may want to use the
