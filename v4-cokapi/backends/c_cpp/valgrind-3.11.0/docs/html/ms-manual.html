<p>To use this tool, you must specify
<code class="option">--tool=massif</code> on the Valgrind
command line.</p>

<a name="ms-manual.overview"></a>9.1. Overview</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Massif is a heap profiler.  It measures how much heap memory your
program uses.  This includes both the useful space, and the extra bytes
allocated for book-keeping and alignment purposes.  It can also
measure the size of your program's stack(s), although it does not do so by
default.</p>
<p>Heap profiling can help you reduce the amount of memory your program
uses.  On modern machines with virtual memory, this provides the following
benefits:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>It can speed up your program -- a smaller
    program will interact better with your machine's caches and
    avoid paging.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>If your program uses lots of memory, it will
    reduce the chance that it exhausts your machine's swap
    space.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Also, there are certain space leaks that aren't detected by
traditional leak-checkers, such as Memcheck's.  That's because
the memory isn't ever actually lost -- a pointer remains to it --
but it's not in use.  Programs that have leaks like this can
unnecessarily increase the amount of memory they are using over
time.  Massif can help identify these leaks.</p>
<p>Importantly, Massif tells you not only how much heap memory your
program is using, it also gives very detailed information that indicates
which parts of your program are responsible for allocating the heap memory.

<a name="ms-manual.using"></a>9.2. Using Massif and ms_print</h2></div></div></div>
<p>First off, as for the other Valgrind tools, you should compile with
debugging info (the <code class="option">-g</code> option).  It shouldn't
matter much what optimisation level you compile your program with, as this
is unlikely to affect the heap memory usage.</p>
<p>Then, you need to run Massif itself to gather the profiling
information, and then run ms_print to present it in a readable way.</p>

<p>An example will make things clear.  Consider the following C program
(annotated with line numbers) which allocates a number of different blocks
on the heap.</p>
<pre class="screen">
 1      #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 2
 3      void g(void)
 4      {
 5         malloc(4000);
 6      }
 7
 8      void f(void)
 9      {
10         malloc(2000);
11         g();
12      }
13
14      int main(void)
15      {
16         int i;
17         int* a[10];
18
19         for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
20            a[i] = malloc(1000);
21         }
22
23         f();
24
25         g();
26
27         for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
28            free(a[i]);
29         }

<p>To gather heap profiling information about the program
<code class="computeroutput">prog</code>, type:</p>
<pre class="screen">
valgrind --tool=massif prog
</pre>
<p>The program will execute (slowly).  Upon completion, no summary
statistics are printed to Valgrind's commentary;  all of Massif's profiling
data is written to a file.  By default, this file is called
<code class="filename">massif.out.&lt;pid&gt;</code>, where
<code class="filename">&lt;pid&gt;</code> is the process ID, although this filename
can be changed with the <code class="option">--massif-out-file</code> option.</p>

<p>To see the information gathered by Massif in an easy-to-read form, use
ms_print.  If the output file's name is
<code class="filename">massif.out.12345</code>, type:</p>
<pre class="screen">
ms_print massif.out.12345</pre>
<p>ms_print will produce (a) a graph showing the memory consumption over
the program's execution, and (b) detailed information about the responsible
allocation sites at various points in the program, including the point of
peak memory allocation.  The use of a separate script for presenting the
results is deliberate:  it separates the data gathering from its
presentation, and means that new methods of presenting the data can be added in
the future.</p>

<p>Why is most of the graph empty, with only a couple of bars at the very
end?  By default, Massif uses "instructions executed" as the unit of time.
For very short-run programs such as the example, most of the executed
instructions involve the loading and dynamic linking of the program.  The
execution of <code class="computeroutput">main</code> (and thus the heap
allocations) only occur at the very end.  For a short-running program like
this, we can use the <code class="option">--time-unit=B</code> option
to specify that we want the time unit to instead be the number of bytes
allocated/deallocated on the heap and stack(s).</p>
<p>If we re-run the program under Massif with this option, and then
re-run ms_print, we get this more useful graph:</p>

</pre>
<p>The size of the graph can be changed with ms_print's
<code class="option">--x</code> and <code class="option">--y</code> options.  Each vertical bar
represents a snapshot, i.e. a measurement of the memory usage at a certain
point in time.  If the next snapshot is more than one column away, a
horizontal line of characters is drawn from the top of the snapshot to just
before the next snapshot column.  The text at the bottom show that 25
snapshots were taken for this program, which is one per heap
allocation/deallocation, plus a couple of extras.  Massif starts by taking
snapshots for every heap allocation/deallocation, but as a program runs for
longer, it takes snapshots less frequently.  It also discards older
snapshots as the program goes on;  when it reaches the maximum number of
snapshots (100 by default, although changeable with the
<code class="option">--max-snapshots</code> option) half of them are
deleted.  This means that a reasonable number of snapshots are always
maintained.</p>
<p>Most snapshots are <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span>, and only basic
information is recorded for them.  Normal snapshots are represented in the
graph by bars consisting of ':' characters.</p>
<p>Some snapshots are <span class="emphasis"><em>detailed</em></span>.  Information about
where allocations happened are recorded for these snapshots, as we will see
shortly.  Detailed snapshots are represented in the graph by bars consisting
of '@' characters.  The text at the bottom show that 3 detailed
snapshots were taken for this program (snapshots 9, 14 and 24).  By default,
every 10th snapshot is detailed, although this can be changed via the
<code class="option">--detailed-freq</code> option.</p>
<p>Finally, there is at most one <span class="emphasis"><em>peak</em></span> snapshot.  The
peak snapshot is a detailed snapshot, and records the point where memory
consumption was greatest.  The peak snapshot is represented in the graph by
a bar consisting of '#' characters.  The text at the bottom shows
that snapshot 14 was the peak.</p>
<p>Massif's determination of when the peak occurred can be wrong, for
two reasons.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>Peak snapshots are only ever taken after a deallocation
  happens.  This avoids lots of unnecessary peak snapshot recordings
  (imagine what happens if your program allocates a lot of heap blocks in
  succession, hitting a new peak every time).  But it means that if your
  program never deallocates any blocks, no peak will be recorded.  It also
  means that if your program does deallocate blocks but later allocates to a
  higher peak without subsequently deallocating, the reported peak will be
  too low.
  </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>Even with this behaviour, recording the peak accurately
  is slow.  So by default Massif records a peak whose size is within 1% of
  the size of the true peak.  This inaccuracy in the peak measurement can be
  changed with the <code class="option">--peak-inaccuracy</code> option.</p></li>

<li class="listitem"><p>The number of useful heap bytes allocated at that point.
  This reflects the number of bytes asked for by the
  program.</p></li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The number of extra heap bytes allocated at that point.
  This reflects the number of bytes allocated in excess of what the program
  asked for.  There are two sources of extra heap bytes.</p>
<p>First, every heap block has administrative bytes associated with it.
  The exact number of administrative bytes depends on the details of the
  allocator.  By default Massif assumes 8 bytes per block, as can be seen
  from the example, but this number can be changed via the
  <code class="option">--heap-admin</code> option.</p>
<p>Second, allocators often round up the number of bytes asked for to a
  larger number, usually 8 or 16.  This is required to ensure that elements
  within the block are suitably aligned.  If N bytes are asked for, Massif
  rounds N up to the nearest multiple of the value specified by the
  <code class="option"><a class="xref" href="manual-core.html#opt.alignment">--alignment</a></code> option.
  </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem"><p>The size of the stack(s).  By default, stack profiling is
  off as it slows Massif down greatly.  Therefore, the stack column is zero
  in the example.  Stack profiling can be turned on with the
  <code class="option">--stacks=yes</code> option.  
  
  </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The next snapshot is detailed.  As well as the basic counts, it gives
an allocation tree which indicates exactly which pieces of code were
responsible for allocating heap memory:</p>
<pre class="screen">
  9          9,072            9,072            9,000            72            0
99.21% (9,000B) (heap allocation functions) malloc/new/new[], --alloc-fns, etc.
-&gt;99.21% (9,000B) 0x804841A: main (example.c:20)
</pre>
<p>The allocation tree can be read from the top down.  The first line
indicates all heap allocation functions such as <code class="function">malloc</code>
and C++ <code class="function">new</code>.  All heap allocations go through these
functions, and so all 9,000 useful bytes (which is 99.21% of all allocated
bytes) go through them.  But how were <code class="function">malloc</code> and new
called?  At this point, every allocation so far has been due to line 20
inside <code class="function">main</code>, hence the second line in the tree.  The
<code class="option">-&gt;</code> indicates that main (line 20) called
<code class="function">malloc</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see what the subsequent output shows happened next:</p>
<pre class="screen">

  -&gt;09.95% (2,000B) 0x8048431: main (example.c:23)
</pre>
<p>The first four snapshots are similar to the previous ones.  But then
the global allocation peak is reached, and a detailed snapshot (number 14)
is taken.  Its allocation tree shows that 20,000B of useful heap memory has
been allocated, and the lines and arrows indicate that this is from three
different code locations: line 20, which is responsible for 10,000B
(49.74%);  line 5, which is responsible for 8,000B (39.79%); and line 10,
which is responsible for 2,000B (9.95%).</p>
<p>We can then drill down further in the allocation tree.  For example,
of the 8,000B asked for by line 5, half of it was due to a call from line
11, and half was due to a call from line 25.</p>
<p>In short, Massif collates the stack trace of every single allocation
point in the program into a single tree, which gives a complete picture at
a particular point in time of how and why all heap memory was
allocated.</p>
<p>Note that the tree entries correspond not to functions, but to
individual code locations.  For example, if function <code class="function">A</code>
calls <code class="function">malloc</code>, and function <code class="function">B</code> calls
<code class="function">A</code> twice, once on line 10 and once on line 11, then
the two calls will result in two distinct stack traces in the tree.  In
contrast, if <code class="function">B</code> calls <code class="function">A</code> repeatedly
from line 15 (e.g. due to a loop), then each of those calls will be
represented by the same stack trace in the tree.</p>
<p>Note also that each tree entry with children in the example satisfies an
invariant: the entry's size is equal to the sum of its children's sizes.
For example, the first entry has size 20,000B, and its children have sizes
10,000B, 8,000B, and 2,000B.  In general, this invariant almost always
holds.  However, in rare circumstances stack traces can be malformed, in
which case a stack trace can be a sub-trace of another stack trace.  This
means that some entries in the tree may not satisfy the invariant -- the
entry's size will be greater than the sum of its children's sizes.  This is
not a big problem, but could make the results confusing.  Massif can
sometimes detect when this happens;  if it does, it issues a warning:</p>
<pre class="screen">
Warning: Malformed stack trace detected.  In Massif's output,
         the size of an entry's child entries may not sum up
         to the entry's size as they normally do.
</pre>
<p>However, Massif does not detect and warn about every such occurrence.
Fortunately, malformed stack traces are rare in practice.</p>
<p>Returning now to ms_print's output, the final part is similar:</p>

</pre>
<p>The final detailed snapshot shows how the heap looked at termination.
The 00.00% entry represents the code locations for which memory was
allocated and then freed (line 20 in this case, the memory for which was
freed on line 28).  However, no code location details are given for this
entry;  by default, Massif only records the details for code locations
responsible for more than 1% of useful memory bytes, and ms_print likewise
only prints the details for code locations responsible for more than 1%.
The entries that do not meet this threshold are aggregated.  This avoids
filling up the output with large numbers of unimportant entries.  The
thresholds can be changed with the
<code class="option">--threshold</code> option that both Massif and
ms_print support.</p>

<a name="ms-manual.not-measured"></a>9.2.8. Measuring All Memory in a Process</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
It is worth emphasising that by default Massif measures only heap memory, i.e.
memory allocated with
<code class="function">malloc</code>,
<code class="function">calloc</code>,
<code class="function">realloc</code>,
<code class="function">memalign</code>,
<code class="function">new</code>,
<code class="function">new[]</code>,
and a few other, similar functions.  (And it can optionally measure stack
memory, of course.)  This means it does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> directly
measure memory allocated with lower-level system calls such as
<code class="function">mmap</code>,
<code class="function">mremap</code>, and
<code class="function">brk</code>.  
</p>
<p>
Heap allocation functions such as <code class="function">malloc</code> are built on
top of these system calls.  For example, when needed, an allocator will
typically call <code class="function">mmap</code> to allocate a large chunk of
memory, and then hand over pieces of that memory chunk to the client program
in response to calls to <code class="function">malloc</code> et al.  Massif directly
measures only these higher-level <code class="function">malloc</code> et al calls,
not the lower-level system calls.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, a client program may use these lower-level system calls
directly to allocate memory.  By default, Massif does not measure these.  Nor
does it measure the size of code, data and BSS segments.  Therefore, the
numbers reported by Massif may be significantly smaller than those reported by
tools such as <code class="filename">top</code> that measure a program's total size in
memory.
</p>
<p>
However, if you wish to measure <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the memory used by
your program, you can use the <code class="option">--pages-as-heap=yes</code>.  When this
option is enabled, Massif's normal heap block profiling is replaced by
lower-level page profiling.  Every page allocated via
<code class="function">mmap</code> and similar system calls is treated as a distinct
block.  This means that code, data and BSS segments are all measured, as they
are just memory pages.  Even the stack is measured, since it is ultimately
allocated (and extended when necessary) via <code class="function">mmap</code>;  for
this reason <code class="option">--stacks=yes</code> is not allowed in conjunction with
<code class="option">--pages-as-heap=yes</code>.
</p>
<p>
After <code class="option">--pages-as-heap=yes</code> is used, ms_print's output is
mostly unchanged.  One difference is that the start of each detailed snapshot
says:
</p>
<pre class="screen">
(page allocation syscalls) mmap/mremap/brk, --alloc-fns, etc.
</pre>
<p>instead of the usual</p>:

<pre class="screen">
(heap allocation functions) malloc/new/new[], --alloc-fns, etc.
</pre>
<p>
The stack traces in the output may be more difficult to read, and interpreting
them may require some detailed understanding of the lower levels of a program
like the memory allocators.  But for some programs having the full information
about memory usage can be very useful.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="ms-manual.acting"></a>9.2.9. Acting on Massif's Information</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Massif's information is generally fairly easy to act upon.  The
obvious place to start looking is the peak snapshot.</p>
<p>It can also be useful to look at the overall shape of the graph, to
see if memory usage climbs and falls as you expect;  spikes in the graph
might be worth investigating.</p>
<p>The detailed snapshots can get quite large.  It is worth viewing them
in a very wide window.   It's also a good idea to view them with a text
editor.  That makes it easy to scroll up and down while keeping the cursor
in a particular column, which makes following the allocation chains easier.

<p>Functions specified with this option will be treated as though
      they were a heap allocation function such as
      <code class="function">malloc</code>.  This is useful for functions that are
      wrappers to <code class="function">malloc</code> or <code class="function">new</code>,
      which can fill up the allocation trees with uninteresting information.
      This option can be specified multiple times on the command line, to
      name multiple functions.</p>
<p>Note that the named function will only be treated this way if it is
      the top entry in a stack trace, or just below another function treated
      this way.  For example, if you have a function
      <code class="function">malloc1</code> that wraps <code class="function">malloc</code>,
      and <code class="function">malloc2</code> that wraps
      <code class="function">malloc1</code>, just specifying
      <code class="option">--alloc-fn=malloc2</code> will have no effect.  You need to
      specify <code class="option">--alloc-fn=malloc1</code> as well.  This is a little
      inconvenient, but the reason is that checking for allocation functions
      is slow, and it saves a lot of time if Massif can stop looking through
      the stack trace entries as soon as it finds one that doesn't match
      rather than having to continue through all the entries.</p>
<p>Note that C++ names are demangled.  Note also that overloaded
      C++ names must be written in full.  Single quotes may be necessary to
      prevent the shell from breaking them up.  For example:
</p>
<pre class="screen">
--alloc-fn='operator new(unsigned, std::nothrow_t const&amp;)'
</pre>

<p>Any direct heap allocation (i.e. a call to
      <code class="function">malloc</code>, <code class="function">new</code>, etc, or a call
      to a function named by an <code class="option">--alloc-fn</code>
      option) that occurs in a function specified by this option will be
      ignored.  This is mostly useful for testing purposes.  This option can
      be specified multiple times on the command line, to name multiple
      functions.
      </p>
<p>Any <code class="function">realloc</code> of an ignored block will
      also be ignored, even if the <code class="function">realloc</code> call does
      not occur in an ignored function.  This avoids the possibility of
      negative heap sizes if ignored blocks are shrunk with
      <code class="function">realloc</code>.

      allocation peak;  by default it records a peak only when the global
      memory allocation size exceeds the previous peak by at least 1.0%.
      This is because there can be many local allocation peaks along the way,
      and doing a detailed snapshot for every one would be expensive and
      wasteful, as all but one of them will be later discarded.  This
      inaccuracy can be changed (even to 0.0%) via this option, but Massif

easy to read for both humans and machines.  Nonetheless, the exact format
is not described here.  This is because the format is currently very
Massif-specific.  In the future we hope to make the format more general, and
thus suitable for possible use with other tools.  Once this has been done,
