.SH "NAME"
valgrind \- a suite of tools for debugging and profiling programs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBvalgrind\fR\ 'u
\fBvalgrind\fR [\fIvalgrind\-options\fR] [\fByour\-program\fR] [\fIyour\-program\-options\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBValgrind\fR
is a flexible program for debugging and profiling Linux executables\&. It consists of a core, which provides a synthetic CPU in software, and a series of debugging and profiling tools\&. The architecture is modular, so that new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the existing structure\&.
.PP
Some of the options described below work with all Valgrind tools, and some only work with a few or one\&. The section MEMCHECK OPTIONS and those below it describe tool\-specific options\&.
.PP
This manual page covers only basic usage and options\&. For more comprehensive information, please see the HTML documentation on your system:
$INSTALL/share/doc/valgrind/html/index\&.html, or online:
http://www\&.valgrind\&.org/docs/manual/index\&.html\&.
.SH "TOOL SELECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The single most important option\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-tool=<toolname> [default: memcheck] \fR
.RS 4
Run the Valgrind tool called
\fItoolname\fR, e\&.g\&. memcheck, cachegrind, callgrind, helgrind, drd, massif, lackey, none, exp\-sgcheck, exp\-bbv, exp\-dhat, etc\&.
.RE
.SH "BASIC OPTIONS"
.PP
These options work with all tools\&.
.PP
\fB\-h \-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show help for all options, both for the core and for the selected tool\&. If the option is repeated it is equivalent to giving
\fB\-\-help\-debug\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Same as
\fB\-\-help\fR, but also lists debugging options which usually are only of use to Valgrind\*(Aqs developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Show the version number of the Valgrind core\&. Tools can have their own version numbers\&. There is a scheme in place to ensure that tools only execute when the core version is one they are known to work with\&. This was done to minimise the chances of strange problems arising from tool\-vs\-core version incompatibilities\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Run silently, and only print error messages\&. Useful if you are running regression tests or have some other automated test machinery\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Be more verbose\&. Gives extra information on various aspects of your program, such as: the shared objects loaded, the suppressions used, the progress of the instrumentation and execution engines, and warnings about unusual behaviour\&. Repeating the option increases the verbosity level\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-trace\-children=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, Valgrind will trace into sub\-processes initiated via the
\fIexec\fR
system call\&. This is necessary for multi\-process programs\&.
.sp
Note that Valgrind does trace into the child of a
\fIfork\fR
(it would be difficult not to, since
\fIfork\fR
makes an identical copy of a process), so this option is arguably badly named\&. However, most children of
\fIfork\fR
calls immediately call
\fIexec\fR
anyway\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-trace\-children\-skip=patt1,patt2,\&.\&.\&. \fR
.RS 4
This option only has an effect when
\fB\-\-trace\-children=yes\fR
is specified\&. It allows for some children to be skipped\&. The option takes a comma separated list of patterns for the names of child executables that Valgrind should not trace into\&. Patterns may include the metacharacters
?
and
*, which have the usual meaning\&.
.sp
This can be useful for pruning uninteresting branches from a tree of processes being run on Valgrind\&. But you should be careful when using it\&. When Valgrind skips tracing into an executable, it doesn\*(Aqt just skip tracing that executable, it also skips tracing any of that executable\*(Aqs child processes\&. In other words, the flag doesn\*(Aqt merely cause tracing to stop at the specified executables \-\- it skips tracing of entire process subtrees rooted at any of the specified executables\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-trace\-children\-skip\-by\-arg=patt1,patt2,\&.\&.\&. \fR
.RS 4
This is the same as
\fB\-\-trace\-children\-skip\fR, with one difference: the decision as to whether to trace into a child process is made by examining the arguments to the child process, rather than the name of its executable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-child\-silent\-after\-fork=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, Valgrind will not show any debugging or logging output for the child process resulting from a
\fIfork\fR
call\&. This can make the output less confusing (although more misleading) when dealing with processes that create children\&. It is particularly useful in conjunction with
\fI\-\-trace\-children=\fR\&. Use of this option is also strongly recommended if you are requesting XML output (\fI\-\-xml=yes\fR), since otherwise the XML from child and parent may become mixed up, which usually makes it useless\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-vgdb=<no|yes|full> [default: yes] \fR
.RS 4
Valgrind will provide "gdbserver" functionality when
\fB\-\-vgdb=yes\fR
or
\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR
is specified\&. This allows an external GNU GDB debugger to control and debug your program when it runs on Valgrind\&.
\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR
incurs significant performance overheads, but provides more precise breakpoints and watchpoints\&. See
Debugging your program using Valgrind's gdbserver and GDB
for a detailed description\&.
.sp
If the embedded gdbserver is enabled but no gdb is currently being used, the
vgdb
command line utility can send "monitor commands" to Valgrind from a shell\&. The Valgrind core provides a set of
Valgrind monitor commands\&. A tool can optionally provide tool specific monitor commands, which are documented in the tool specific chapter\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-vgdb\-error=<number> [default: 999999999] \fR
.RS 4
Use this option when the Valgrind gdbserver is enabled with
\fB\-\-vgdb=yes\fR
or
\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR\&. Tools that report errors will wait for "number" errors to be reported before freezing the program and waiting for you to connect with GDB\&. It follows that a value of zero will cause the gdbserver to be started before your program is executed\&. This is typically used to insert GDB breakpoints before execution, and also works with tools that do not report errors, such as Massif\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-vgdb\-stop\-at=<set> [default: none] \fR
.RS 4
Use this option when the Valgrind gdbserver is enabled with
\fB\-\-vgdb=yes\fR
or
\fB\-\-vgdb=full\fR\&. The Valgrind gdbserver will be invoked for each error after
\fB\-\-vgdb\-error\fR
have been reported\&. You can additionally ask the Valgrind gdbserver to be invoked for other events, specified in one of the following ways:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
a comma separated list of one or more of
\fBstartup exit valgrindabexit\fR\&.
.sp
The values
\fBstartup\fR\fBexit\fR\fBvalgrindabexit\fR
respectively indicate to invoke gdbserver before your program is executed, after the last instruction of your program, on Valgrind abnormal exit (e\&.g\&. internal error, out of memory, \&.\&.\&.)\&.
.sp
Note:
\fBstartup\fR
and
\fB\-\-vgdb\-error=0\fR
will both cause Valgrind gdbserver to be invoked before your program is executed\&. The
\fB\-\-vgdb\-error=0\fR
will in addition cause your program to stop on all subsequent errors\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBall\fR
to specify the complete set\&. It is equivalent to
\fB\-\-vgdb\-stop\-at=startup,exit,valgrindabexit\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBnone\fR
for the empty set\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-track\-fds=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, Valgrind will print out a list of open file descriptors on exit or on request, via the gdbserver monitor command
\fIv\&.info open_fds\fR\&. Along with each file descriptor is printed a stack backtrace of where the file was opened and any details relating to the file descriptor such as the file name or socket details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-time\-stamp=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, each message is preceded with an indication of the elapsed wallclock time since startup, expressed as days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-fd=<number> [default: 2, stderr] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages to the specified file descriptor\&. The default, 2, is the standard error channel (stderr)\&. Note that this may interfere with the client\*(Aqs own use of stderr, as Valgrind\*(Aqs output will be interleaved with any output that the client sends to stderr\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-file=<filename> \fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages to the specified file\&. If the file name is empty, it causes an abort\&. There are three special format specifiers that can be used in the file name\&.
.sp
\fB%p\fR
is replaced with the current process ID\&. This is very useful for program that invoke multiple processes\&. WARNING: If you use
\fB\-\-trace\-children=yes\fR
and your program invokes multiple processes OR your program forks without calling exec afterwards, and you don\*(Aqt use this specifier (or the
\fB%q\fR
specifier below), the Valgrind output from all those processes will go into one file, possibly jumbled up, and possibly incomplete\&.
.sp
\fB%q{FOO}\fR
is replaced with the contents of the environment variable
\fIFOO\fR\&. If the
\fB{FOO}\fR
part is malformed, it causes an abort\&. This specifier is rarely needed, but very useful in certain circumstances (eg\&. when running MPI programs)\&. The idea is that you specify a variable which will be set differently for each process in the job, for example
BPROC_RANK
or whatever is applicable in your MPI setup\&. If the named environment variable is not set, it causes an abort\&. Note that in some shells, the
\fB{\fR
and
\fB}\fR
characters may need to be escaped with a backslash\&.
.sp
\fB%%\fR
is replaced with
\fB%\fR\&.
.sp
If an
\fB%\fR
is followed by any other character, it causes an abort\&.
.sp
If the file name specifies a relative file name, it is put in the program\*(Aqs initial working directory : this is the current directory when the program started its execution after the fork or after the exec\&. If it specifies an absolute file name (ie\&. starts with \*(Aq/\*(Aq) then it is put there\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-log\-socket=<ip\-address:port\-number> \fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages to the specified port at the specified IP address\&. The port may be omitted, in which case port 1500 is used\&. If a connection cannot be made to the specified socket, Valgrind falls back to writing output to the standard error (stderr)\&. This option is intended to be used in conjunction with the
valgrind\-listener
program\&. For further details, see
the commentary
in the manual\&.
.RE
.SH "ERROR-RELATED OPTIONS"
.PP
These options are used by all tools that can report errors, e\&.g\&. Memcheck, but not Cachegrind\&.
.PP
\fB\-\-xml=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, the important parts of the output (e\&.g\&. tool error messages) will be in XML format rather than plain text\&. Furthermore, the XML output will be sent to a different output channel than the plain text output\&. Therefore, you also must use one of
\fB\-\-xml\-fd\fR,
\fB\-\-xml\-file\fR
or
\fB\-\-xml\-socket\fR
to specify where the XML is to be sent\&.
.sp
Less important messages will still be printed in plain text, but because the XML output and plain text output are sent to different output channels (the destination of the plain text output is still controlled by
\fB\-\-log\-fd\fR,
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR
and
\fB\-\-log\-socket\fR) this should not cause problems\&.
.sp
This option is aimed at making life easier for tools that consume Valgrind\*(Aqs output as input, such as GUI front ends\&. Currently this option works with Memcheck, Helgrind, DRD and SGcheck\&. The output format is specified in the file
docs/internals/xml\-output\-protocol4\&.txt
in the source tree for Valgrind 3\&.5\&.0 or later\&.
.sp
The recommended options for a GUI to pass, when requesting XML output, are:
\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR
to enable XML output,
\fB\-\-xml\-file\fR
to send the XML output to a (presumably GUI\-selected) file,
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR
to send the plain text output to a second GUI\-selected file,
\fB\-\-child\-silent\-after\-fork=yes\fR, and
\fB\-q\fR
to restrict the plain text output to critical error messages created by Valgrind itself\&. For example, failure to read a specified suppressions file counts as a critical error message\&. In this way, for a successful run the text output file will be empty\&. But if it isn\*(Aqt empty, then it will contain important information which the GUI user should be made aware of\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xml\-fd=<number> [default: \-1, disabled] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Valgrind should send its XML output to the specified file descriptor\&. It must be used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xml\-file=<filename> \fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Valgrind should send its XML output to the specified file\&. It must be used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR\&. Any
\fB%p\fR
or
\fB%q\fR
sequences appearing in the filename are expanded in exactly the same way as they are for
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR\&. See the description of
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xml\-socket=<ip\-address:port\-number> \fR
.RS 4
Specifies that Valgrind should send its XML output the specified port at the specified IP address\&. It must be used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR\&. The form of the argument is the same as that used by
\fB\-\-log\-socket\fR\&. See the description of
\fB\-\-log\-socket\fR
for further details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-xml\-user\-comment=<string> \fR
.RS 4
Embeds an extra user comment string at the start of the XML output\&. Only works when
\fB\-\-xml=yes\fR
is specified; ignored otherwise\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-demangle=<yes|no> [default: yes] \fR
.RS 4
Enable/disable automatic demangling (decoding) of C++ names\&. Enabled by default\&. When enabled, Valgrind will attempt to translate encoded C++ names back to something approaching the original\&. The demangler handles symbols mangled by g++ versions 2\&.X, 3\&.X and 4\&.X\&.
.sp
An important fact about demangling is that function names mentioned in suppressions files should be in their mangled form\&. Valgrind does not demangle function names when searching for applicable suppressions, because to do otherwise would make suppression file contents dependent on the state of Valgrind\*(Aqs demangling machinery, and also slow down suppression matching\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-num\-callers=<number> [default: 12] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum number of entries shown in stack traces that identify program locations\&. Note that errors are commoned up using only the top four function locations (the place in the current function, and that of its three immediate callers)\&. So this doesn\*(Aqt affect the total number of errors reported\&.
.sp
The maximum value for this is 500\&. Note that higher settings will make Valgrind run a bit more slowly and take a bit more memory, but can be useful when working with programs with deeply\-nested call chains\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-unw\-stack\-scan\-thresh=<number> [default: 0] \fR, \fB\-\-unw\-stack\-scan\-frames=<number> [default: 5] \fR
.RS 4
Stack\-scanning support is available only on ARM targets\&.
.sp
These flags enable and control stack unwinding by stack scanning\&. When the normal stack unwinding mechanisms \-\- usage of Dwarf CFI records, and frame\-pointer following \-\- fail, stack scanning may be able to recover a stack trace\&.
.sp
Note that stack scanning is an imprecise, heuristic mechanism that may give very misleading results, or none at all\&. It should be used only in emergencies, when normal unwinding fails, and it is important to nevertheless have stack traces\&.
.sp
Stack scanning is a simple technique: the unwinder reads words from the stack, and tries to guess which of them might be return addresses, by checking to see if they point just after ARM or Thumb call instructions\&. If so, the word is added to the backtrace\&.
.sp
The main danger occurs when a function call returns, leaving its return address exposed, and a new function is called, but the new function does not overwrite the old address\&. The result of this is that the backtrace may contain entries for functions which have already returned, and so be very confusing\&.
.sp
A second limitation of this implementation is that it will scan only the page (4KB, normally) containing the starting stack pointer\&. If the stack frames are large, this may result in only a few (or not even any) being present in the trace\&. Also, if you are unlucky and have an initial stack pointer near the end of its containing page, the scan may miss all interesting frames\&.
.sp
By default stack scanning is disabled\&. The normal use case is to ask for it when a stack trace would otherwise be very short\&. So, to enable it, use
\-\-unw\-stack\-scan\-thresh=number\&. This requests Valgrind to try using stack scanning to "extend" stack traces which contain fewer than
number
frames\&.
.sp
If stack scanning does take place, it will only generate at most the number of frames specified by
\-\-unw\-stack\-scan\-frames\&. Typically, stack scanning generates so many garbage entries that this value is set to a low value (5) by default\&. In no case will a stack trace larger than the value specified by
\-\-num\-callers
be created\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-error\-limit=<yes|no> [default: yes] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, Valgrind stops reporting errors after 10,000,000 in total, or 1,000 different ones, have been seen\&. This is to stop the error tracking machinery from becoming a huge performance overhead in programs with many errors\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-error\-exitcode=<number> [default: 0] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies an alternative exit code to return if Valgrind reported any errors in the run\&. When set to the default value (zero), the return value from Valgrind will always be the return value of the process being simulated\&. When set to a nonzero value, that value is returned instead, if Valgrind detects any errors\&. This is useful for using Valgrind as part of an automated test suite, since it makes it easy to detect test cases for which Valgrind has reported errors, just by inspecting return codes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-error\-markers=<begin>,<end> [default: none]\fR
.RS 4
When errors are output as plain text (i\&.e\&. XML not used),
\fB\-\-error\-markers\fR
instructs to output a line containing the
\fBbegin\fR
(\fBend\fR) string before (after) each error\&.
.sp
Such marker lines facilitate searching for errors and/or extracting errors in an output file that contain valgrind errors mixed with the program output\&.
.sp
Note that empty markers are accepted\&. So, only using a begin (or an end) marker is possible\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sigill\-diagnostics=<yes|no> [default: yes] \fR
.RS 4
Enable/disable printing of illegal instruction diagnostics\&. Enabled by default, but defaults to disabled when
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
is given\&. The default can always be explicitly overridden by giving this option\&.
.sp
When enabled, a warning message will be printed, along with some diagnostics, whenever an instruction is encountered that Valgrind cannot decode or translate, before the program is given a SIGILL signal\&. Often an illegal instruction indicates a bug in the program or missing support for the particular instruction in Valgrind\&. But some programs do deliberately try to execute an instruction that might be missing and trap the SIGILL signal to detect processor features\&. Using this flag makes it possible to avoid the diagnostic output that you would otherwise get in such cases\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-below\-main=<yes|no> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
By default, stack traces for errors do not show any functions that appear beneath
\fBmain\fR
because most of the time it\*(Aqs uninteresting C library stuff and/or gobbledygook\&. Alternatively, if
\fBmain\fR
is not present in the stack trace, stack traces will not show any functions below
\fBmain\fR\-like functions such as glibc\*(Aqs
\fB__libc_start_main\fR\&. Furthermore, if
\fBmain\fR\-like functions are present in the trace, they are normalised as
\fB(below main)\fR, in order to make the output more deterministic\&.
.sp
If this option is enabled, all stack trace entries will be shown and
\fBmain\fR\-like functions will not be normalised\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=<string> [default: don\*(Aqt show source paths] \fR
.RS 4
By default Valgrind only shows the filenames in stack traces, but not full paths to source files\&. When using Valgrind in large projects where the sources reside in multiple different directories, this can be inconvenient\&.
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after\fR
provides a flexible solution to this problem\&. When this option is present, the path to each source file is shown, with the following all\-important caveat: if
\fBstring\fR
is found in the path, then the path up to and including
\fBstring\fR
is omitted, else the path is shown unmodified\&. Note that
\fBstring\fR
is not required to be a prefix of the path\&.
.sp
For example, consider a file named
/home/janedoe/blah/src/foo/bar/xyzzy\&.c\&. Specifying
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=/home/janedoe/blah/src/\fR
will cause Valgrind to show the name as
foo/bar/xyzzy\&.c\&.
.sp
Because the string is not required to be a prefix,
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=src/\fR
will produce the same output\&. This is useful when the path contains arbitrary machine\-generated characters\&. For example, the path
/my/build/dir/C32A1B47/blah/src/foo/xyzzy
can be pruned to
foo/xyzzy
using
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=/blah/src/\fR\&.
.sp
If you simply want to see the full path, just specify an empty string:
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after=\fR\&. This isn\*(Aqt a special case, merely a logical consequence of the above rules\&.
.sp
Finally, you can use
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after\fR
multiple times\&. Any appearance of it causes Valgrind to switch to producing full paths and applying the above filtering rule\&. Each produced path is compared against all the
\fB\-\-fullpath\-after\fR\-specified strings, in the order specified\&. The first string to match causes the path to be truncated as described above\&. If none match, the full path is shown\&. This facilitates chopping off prefixes when the sources are drawn from a number of unrelated directories\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-extra\-debuginfo\-path=<path> [default: undefined and unused] \fR
.RS 4
By default Valgrind searches in several well\-known paths for debug objects, such as
/usr/lib/debug/\&.
.sp
However, there may be scenarios where you may wish to put debug objects at an arbitrary location, such as external storage when running Valgrind on a mobile device with limited local storage\&. Another example might be a situation where you do not have permission to install debug object packages on the system where you are running Valgrind\&.
.sp
In these scenarios, you may provide an absolute path as an extra, final place for Valgrind to search for debug objects by specifying
\fB\-\-extra\-debuginfo\-path=/path/to/debug/objects\fR\&. The given path will be prepended to the absolute path name of the searched\-for object\&. For example, if Valgrind is looking for the debuginfo for
/w/x/y/zz\&.so
and
\fB\-\-extra\-debuginfo\-path=/a/b/c\fR
is specified, it will look for a debug object at
/a/b/c/w/x/y/zz\&.so\&.
.sp
This flag should only be specified once\&. If it is specified multiple times, only the last instance is honoured\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debuginfo\-server=ipaddr:port [default: undefined and unused]\fR
.RS 4
This is a new, experimental, feature introduced in version 3\&.9\&.0\&.
.sp
In some scenarios it may be convenient to read debuginfo from objects stored on a different machine\&. With this flag, Valgrind will query a debuginfo server running on
ipaddr
and listening on port
port, if it cannot find the debuginfo object in the local filesystem\&.
.sp
The debuginfo server must accept TCP connections on port
port\&. The debuginfo server is contained in the source file
auxprogs/valgrind\-di\-server\&.c\&. It will only serve from the directory it is started in\&.
port
defaults to 1500 in both client and server if not specified\&.
.sp
If Valgrind looks for the debuginfo for
/w/x/y/zz\&.so
by using the debuginfo server, it will strip the pathname components and merely request
zz\&.so
on the server\&. That in turn will look only in its current working directory for a matching debuginfo object\&.
.sp
The debuginfo data is transmitted in small fragments (8 KB) as requested by Valgrind\&. Each block is compressed using LZO to reduce transmission time\&. The implementation has been tuned for best performance over a single\-stage 802\&.11g (WiFi) network link\&.
.sp
Note that checks for matching primary vs debug objects, using GNU debuglink CRC scheme, are performed even when using the debuginfo server\&. To disable such checking, you need to also specify
\-\-allow\-mismatched\-debuginfo=yes\&.
.sp
By default the Valgrind build system will build
valgrind\-di\-server
for the target platform, which is almost certainly not what you want\&. So far we have been unable to find out how to get automake/autoconf to build it for the build platform\&. If you want to use it, you will have to recompile it by hand using the command shown at the top of
auxprogs/valgrind\-di\-server\&.c\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-allow\-mismatched\-debuginfo=no|yes [no] \fR
.RS 4
When reading debuginfo from separate debuginfo objects, Valgrind will by default check that the main and debuginfo objects match, using the GNU debuglink mechanism\&. This guarantees that it does not read debuginfo from out of date debuginfo objects, and also ensures that Valgrind can\*(Aqt crash as a result of mismatches\&.
.sp
This check can be overridden using
\-\-allow\-mismatched\-debuginfo=yes\&. This may be useful when the debuginfo and main objects have not been split in the proper way\&. Be careful when using this, though: it disables all consistency checking, and Valgrind has been observed to crash when the main and debuginfo objects don\*(Aqt match\&.

When set to

This option is particularly useful with C++ programs, as it prints out the suppressions with mangled names, as required\&.

Note that the suppressions printed are as specific as possible\&. You may want to common up similar ones, by adding wildcards to function names, and by using frame\-level wildcards\&. The wildcarding facilities are powerful yet flexible, and with a bit of careful editing, you may be able to suppress a whole family of related errors with only a few suppressions\&.

Sometimes two different errors are suppressed by the same suppression, in which case Valgrind will output the suppression more than once, but you only need to have one copy in your suppression file (but having more than one won\*(Aqt cause problems)\&. Also, the suppression name is given as

\fB\-\-dsymutil=no|yes [yes] \fR
.RS 4
This option is only relevant when running Valgrind on Mac OS X\&.
.sp
Mac OS X uses a deferred debug information (debuginfo) linking scheme\&. When object files containing debuginfo are linked into a
\&.dylib
or an executable, the debuginfo is not copied into the final file\&. Instead, the debuginfo must be linked manually by running
dsymutil, a system\-provided utility, on the executable or
\&.dylib\&. The resulting combined debuginfo is placed in a directory alongside the executable or
\&.dylib, but with the extension
\&.dSYM\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-dsymutil=no\fR, Valgrind will detect cases where the
\&.dSYM
directory is either missing, or is present but does not appear to match the associated executable or
\&.dylib, most likely because it is out of date\&. In these cases, Valgrind will print a warning message but take no further action\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-dsymutil=yes\fR, Valgrind will, in such cases, automatically run
dsymutil
as necessary to bring the debuginfo up to date\&. For all practical purposes, if you always use
\fB\-\-dsymutil=yes\fR, then there is never any need to run
dsymutil
manually or as part of your applications\*(Aqs build system, since Valgrind will run it as necessary\&.
.sp
Valgrind will not attempt to run
dsymutil
on any executable or library in
/usr/,
/bin/,
/sbin/,
/opt/,
/sw/,
/System/,
/Library/
or
/Applications/
since
dsymutil
will always fail in such situations\&. It fails both because the debuginfo for such pre\-installed system components is not available anywhere, and also because it would require write privileges in those directories\&.
.sp
Be careful when using
\fB\-\-dsymutil=yes\fR, since it will cause pre\-existing
\&.dSYM
directories to be silently deleted and re\-created\&. Also note that
dsymutil
is quite slow, sometimes excessively so\&.

\fB\-\-max\-stackframe=<number> [default: 2000000] \fR
.RS 4
The maximum size of a stack frame\&. If the stack pointer moves by more than this amount then Valgrind will assume that the program is switching to a different stack\&.
.sp
You may need to use this option if your program has large stack\-allocated arrays\&. Valgrind keeps track of your program\*(Aqs stack pointer\&. If it changes by more than the threshold amount, Valgrind assumes your program is switching to a different stack, and Memcheck behaves differently than it would for a stack pointer change smaller than the threshold\&. Usually this heuristic works well\&. However, if your program allocates large structures on the stack, this heuristic will be fooled, and Memcheck will subsequently report large numbers of invalid stack accesses\&. This option allows you to change the threshold to a different value\&.
.sp
You should only consider use of this option if Valgrind\*(Aqs debug output directs you to do so\&. In that case it will tell you the new threshold you should specify\&.
.sp
In general, allocating large structures on the stack is a bad idea, because you can easily run out of stack space, especially on systems with limited memory or which expect to support large numbers of threads each with a small stack, and also because the error checking performed by Memcheck is more effective for heap\-allocated data than for stack\-allocated data\&. If you have to use this option, you may wish to consider rewriting your code to allocate on the heap rather than on the stack\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-main\-stacksize=<number> [default: use current \*(Aqulimit\*(Aq value] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies the size of the main thread\*(Aqs stack\&.
.sp
To simplify its memory management, Valgrind reserves all required space for the main thread\*(Aqs stack at startup\&. That means it needs to know the required stack size at startup\&.
.sp
By default, Valgrind uses the current "ulimit" value for the stack size, or 16 MB, whichever is lower\&. In many cases this gives a stack size in the range 8 to 16 MB, which almost never overflows for most applications\&.
.sp
If you need a larger total stack size, use
\fB\-\-main\-stacksize\fR
to specify it\&. Only set it as high as you need, since reserving far more space than you need (that is, hundreds of megabytes more than you need) constrains Valgrind\*(Aqs memory allocators and may reduce the total amount of memory that Valgrind can use\&. This is only really of significance on 32\-bit machines\&.
.sp
On Linux, you may request a stack of size up to 2GB\&. Valgrind will stop with a diagnostic message if the stack cannot be allocated\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-main\-stacksize\fR
only affects the stack size for the program\*(Aqs initial thread\&. It has no bearing on the size of thread stacks, as Valgrind does not allocate those\&.
.sp
You may need to use both
\fB\-\-main\-stacksize\fR
and
\fB\-\-max\-stackframe\fR
together\&. It is important to understand that
\fB\-\-main\-stacksize\fR
sets the maximum total stack size, whilst
\fB\-\-max\-stackframe\fR
specifies the largest size of any one stack frame\&. You will have to work out the
\fB\-\-main\-stacksize\fR
value for yourself (usually, if your applications segfaults)\&. But Valgrind will tell you the needed
\fB\-\-max\-stackframe\fR
size, if necessary\&.
.sp
As discussed further in the description of
\fB\-\-max\-stackframe\fR, a requirement for a large stack is a sign of potential portability problems\&. You are best advised to place all large data in heap\-allocated memory\&.

By default Valgrind\*(Aqs
\fBmalloc\fR,
\fBrealloc\fR, etc, return a block whose starting address is 8\-byte aligned or 16\-byte aligned (the value depends on the platform and matches the platform default)\&.

\fB\-\-redzone\-size=<number> [default: depends on the tool] \fR
.RS 4
Valgrind\*(Aqs
\fBmalloc, realloc,\fR
etc, add padding blocks before and after each heap block allocated by the program being run\&. Such padding blocks are called redzones\&. The default value for the redzone size depends on the tool\&. For example, Memcheck adds and protects a minimum of 16 bytes before and after each block allocated by the client\&. This allows it to detect block underruns or overruns of up to 16 bytes\&.
.sp
Increasing the redzone size makes it possible to detect overruns of larger distances, but increases the amount of memory used by Valgrind\&. Decreasing the redzone size will reduce the memory needed by Valgrind but also reduces the chances of detecting over/underruns, so is not recommended\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-smc\-check=<none|stack|all|all\-non\-file> [default: all\-non\-file for x86/amd64/s390x, stack for other archs] \fR
.RS 4
This option controls Valgrind\*(Aqs detection of self\-modifying code\&. If no checking is done, when a program executes some code, then overwrites it with new code, and executes the new code, Valgrind will continue to execute the translations it made for the old code\&. This will likely lead to incorrect behaviour and/or crashes\&.
.sp
For "modern" architectures \-\- anything that\*(Aqs not x86, amd64 or s390x \-\- the default is
\fIstack\fR\&. This is because a correct program must take explicit action to reestablish D\-I cache coherence following code modification\&. Valgrind observes and honours such actions, with the result that self\-modifying code is transparently handled with zero extra cost\&.
.sp
For x86, amd64 and s390x, the program is not required to notify the hardware of required D\-I coherence syncing\&. Hence the default is
\fIall\-non\-file\fR, which covers the normal case of generating code into an anonymous (non\-file\-backed) mmap\*(Aqd area\&.
.sp
The meanings of the four available settings are as follows\&. No detection (\fInone\fR), detect self\-modifying code on the stack (which is used by GCC to implement nested functions) (\fIstack\fR), detect self\-modifying code everywhere (\fIall\fR), and detect self\-modifying code everywhere except in file\-backed mappings (\fIall\-non\-file\fR)\&.
.sp
Running with
\fIall\fR
will slow Valgrind down noticeably\&. Running with
\fInone\fR
will rarely speed things up, since very little code gets dynamically generated in most programs\&. The
\fBVALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS\fR
client request is an alternative to
\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\fR
and
\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\-non\-file\fR
that requires more programmer effort but allows Valgrind to run your program faster, by telling it precisely when translations need to be re\-made\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\-non\-file\fR
provides a cheaper but more limited version of
\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\fR\&. It adds checks to any translations that do not originate from file\-backed memory mappings\&. Typical applications that generate code, for example JITs in web browsers, generate code into anonymous mmaped areas, whereas the "fixed" code of the browser always lives in file\-backed mappings\&.
\fB\-\-smc\-check=all\-non\-file\fR
takes advantage of this observation, limiting the overhead of checking to code which is likely to be JIT generated\&.

Usually it doesn\*(Aqt bother to free that memory when the program ends\(emthere would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims all process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would just slow things down\&.

The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes leak checkers, such as Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in glibc, when a leak check is done at exit\&. In order to avoid this, they provided a routine called

This hint is only relevant when running Valgrind on Linux\&.

The GNU glibc pthread library (\fBlibpthread\&.so\fR), which is used by pthread programs, maintains a cache of pthread stacks\&. When a pthread terminates, the memory used for the pthread stack and some thread local storage related data structure are not always directly released\&. This memory is kept in a cache (up to a certain size), and is re\-used if a new thread is started\&.
.sp
This cache causes the helgrind tool to report some false positive race condition errors on this cached memory, as helgrind does not understand the internal glibc cache synchronisation primitives\&. So, when using helgrind, disabling the cache helps to avoid false positive race conditions, in particular when using thread local storage variables (e\&.g\&. variables using the

.sp
When using the memcheck tool, disabling the cache ensures the memory used by glibc to handle __thread variables is directly released when a thread terminates\&.

Note: Valgrind disables the cache using some internal knowledge of the glibc stack cache implementation and by examining the debug information of the pthread library\&. This technique is thus somewhat fragile and might not work for all glibc versions\&.

Some recursive algorithms, for example balanced binary tree implementations, create many different stack traces, each containing cycles of calls\&. A cycle is defined as two identical program counter values separated by zero or more other program counter values\&. Valgrind may then use a lot of memory to store all these stack traces\&. This is a poor use of memory considering that such stack traces contain repeated uninteresting recursive calls instead of more interesting information such as the function that has initiated the recursive call\&.
.sp
The option
\fB\-\-merge\-recursive\-frames=<number>\fR

\fB<number>\fR

The value 0 (the default) causes no recursive call merging\&. A value of 1 will cause stack traces of simple recursive algorithms (for example, a factorial implementation) to be collapsed\&.

If the "executed instructions" working set of a program is big, increasing the number of sectors may improve performance by reducing the number of re\-translations needed\&.

This often makes it difficult to track down the root problem\&.
.sp
When set to
\fIyes\fR, Memcheck keeps track of the origins of all uninitialised values\&. Then, when an uninitialised value error is reported, Memcheck will try to show the origin of the value\&. An origin can be one of the following four places: a heap block, a stack allocation, a client request, or miscellaneous other sources (eg, a call to
\fIbrk\fR)\&.
.sp
For uninitialised values originating from a heap block, Memcheck shows where the block was allocated\&. For uninitialised values originating from a stack allocation, Memcheck can tell you which function allocated the value, but no more than that \-\- typically it shows you the source location of the opening brace of the function\&. So you should carefully check that all of the function\*(Aqs local variables are initialised properly\&.
.sp
Performance overhead: origin tracking is expensive\&. It halves Memcheck\*(Aqs speed and increases memory use by a minimum of 100MB, and possibly more\&. Nevertheless it can drastically reduce the effort required to identify the root cause of uninitialised value errors, and so is often a programmer productivity win, despite running more slowly\&.

With
\fIalloc\-then\-free\fR, a stack trace is recorded at allocation time, and is associated with the block\&. When the block is freed, a second stack trace is recorded, and this replaces the allocation stack trace\&. As a result, any "use after free" errors relating to this block can only show a stack trace for where the block was freed\&.
.sp
With
\fIalloc\-and\-free\fR, both allocation and the deallocation stack traces for the block are stored\&. Hence a "use after free" error will show both, which may make the error easier to diagnose\&. Compared to
\fIalloc\-then\-free\fR, this setting slightly increases Valgrind\*(Aqs memory use as the block contains two references instead of one\&.
.sp
With
\fIalloc\fR, only the allocation stack trace is recorded (and reported)\&. With
\fIfree\fR, only the deallocation stack trace is recorded (and reported)\&. These values somewhat decrease Valgrind\*(Aqs memory and cpu usage\&. They can be useful depending on the error types you are searching for and the level of detail you need to analyse them\&. For example, if you are only interested in memory leak errors, it is sufficient to record the allocation stack traces\&.
.sp
With
\fInone\fR, no stack traces are recorded for malloc and free operations\&. If your program allocates a lot of blocks and/or allocates/frees from many different stack traces, this can significantly decrease cpu and/or memory required\&. Of course, few details will be reported for errors related to heap blocks\&.
.sp
Note that once a stack trace is recorded, Valgrind keeps the stack trace in memory even if it is not referenced by any block\&. Some programs (for example, recursive algorithms) can generate a huge number of stack traces\&. If Valgrind uses too much memory in such circumstances, you can reduce the memory required with the options

.SH "HELGRIND OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-free\-is\-write=no|yes [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled (not the default), Helgrind treats freeing of heap memory as if the memory was written immediately before the free\&. This exposes races where memory is referenced by one thread, and freed by another, but there is no observable synchronisation event to ensure that the reference happens before the free\&.
.sp
This functionality is new in Valgrind 3\&.7\&.0, and is regarded as experimental\&. It is not enabled by default because its interaction with custom memory allocators is not well understood at present\&. User feedback is welcomed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-track\-lockorders=no|yes [default: yes] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled (the default), Helgrind performs lock order consistency checking\&. For some buggy programs, the large number of lock order errors reported can become annoying, particularly if you\*(Aqre only interested in race errors\&. You may therefore find it helpful to disable lock order checking\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-history\-level=none|approx|full [default: full] \fR
.RS 4
\fB\-\-history\-level=full\fR
(the default) causes Helgrind collects enough information about "old" accesses that it can produce two stack traces in a race report \-\- both the stack trace for the current access, and the trace for the older, conflicting access\&. To limit memory usage, "old" accesses stack traces are limited to a maximum of 8 entries, even if
\fB\-\-num\-callers\fR
value is bigger\&.
.sp
Collecting such information is expensive in both speed and memory, particularly for programs that do many inter\-thread synchronisation events (locks, unlocks, etc)\&. Without such information, it is more difficult to track down the root causes of races\&. Nonetheless, you may not need it in situations where you just want to check for the presence or absence of races, for example, when doing regression testing of a previously race\-free program\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-history\-level=none\fR
is the opposite extreme\&. It causes Helgrind not to collect any information about previous accesses\&. This can be dramatically faster than
\fB\-\-history\-level=full\fR\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-history\-level=approx\fR
provides a compromise between these two extremes\&. It causes Helgrind to show a full trace for the later access, and approximate information regarding the earlier access\&. This approximate information consists of two stacks, and the earlier access is guaranteed to have occurred somewhere between program points denoted by the two stacks\&. This is not as useful as showing the exact stack for the previous access (as
\fB\-\-history\-level=full\fR
does), but it is better than nothing, and it is almost as fast as
\fB\-\-history\-level=none\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-conflict\-cache\-size=N [default: 1000000] \fR
.RS 4
This flag only has any effect at
\fB\-\-history\-level=full\fR\&.
.sp
Information about "old" conflicting accesses is stored in a cache of limited size, with LRU\-style management\&. This is necessary because it isn\*(Aqt practical to store a stack trace for every single memory access made by the program\&. Historical information on not recently accessed locations is periodically discarded, to free up space in the cache\&.
.sp
This option controls the size of the cache, in terms of the number of different memory addresses for which conflicting access information is stored\&. If you find that Helgrind is showing race errors with only one stack instead of the expected two stacks, try increasing this value\&.
.sp
The minimum value is 10,000 and the maximum is 30,000,000 (thirty times the default value)\&. Increasing the value by 1 increases Helgrind\*(Aqs memory requirement by very roughly 100 bytes, so the maximum value will easily eat up three extra gigabytes or so of memory\&.
.RE

\fB\-\-check\-stack\-refs=no|yes [default: yes] \fR

\fB\-\-ignore\-thread\-creation=<yes|no> [default: no]\fR
.RS 4
Controls whether all activities during thread creation should be ignored\&. By default enabled only on Solaris\&. Solaris provides higher throughput, parallelism and scalability than other operating systems, at the cost of more fine\-grained locking activity\&. This means for example that when a thread is created under glibc, just one big lock is used for all thread setup\&. Solaris libc uses several fine\-grained locks and the creator thread resumes its activities as soon as possible, leaving for example stack and TLS setup sequence to the created thread\&. This situation confuses Helgrind as it assumes there is some false ordering in place between creator and created thread; and therefore many types of race conditions in the application would not be reported\&. To prevent such false ordering, this command line option is set to

This option selects the name of the PC file\&. This file holds program counter addresses and function name info for the various basic blocks\&. This can be used in conjunction with the basic block vector file to fast\-forward via function names instead of just instruction counts\&. The

\fB\-\-interval\-size=<number> [default: 100000000] \fR
.RS 4
This option selects the size of the interval to use\&. The default is 100 million instructions, which is a commonly used value\&. Other sizes can be used; smaller intervals can help programs with finer\-grained phases\&. However smaller interval size can lead to accuracy issues due to warm\-up effects (When fast\-forwarding the various architectural features will be un\-initialized, and it will take some number of instructions before they "warm up" to the state a full simulation would be at without the fast\-forwarding\&. Large interval sizes tend to mitigate this\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-instr\-count\-only [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
This option tells the tool to only display instruction count totals, and to not generate the actual basic block vector file\&. This is useful for debugging, and for gathering instruction count info without generating the large basic block vector files\&.

When enabled, Lackey prints a table containing counts of loads, stores and ALU operations, differentiated by their IR types\&. The IR types are identified by their IR name ("I1", "I8", \&.\&.\&. "I128", "F32", "F64", and "V128")\&.

When enabled, Lackey prints the size and address of almost every memory access made by the program\&. See the comments at the top of the file

\fB\-\-trace\-superblocks=<no|yes> [default: no] \fR

When enabled, Lackey prints out the address of every superblock (a single entry, multiple exit, linear chunk of code) executed by the program\&. This is primarily of interest to Valgrind developers\&. See the comments at the top of the file
