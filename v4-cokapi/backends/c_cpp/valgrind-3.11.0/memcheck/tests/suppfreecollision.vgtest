# this test the case of two errors, one considered not dangerous and
# suppressed, the other considered dangerous, and the user does
# not want to supress it.
# The suppression entry only match the non dangerous error.
# However, when a medium resolution is used to compare 2 errors,
# only the last 4 calls are used to determine that two errors are similar
# So, the nondangerous suppressed error "absorbs and hides" the dangerous
# error.
# This side effect of a medium (or low) resolution for error matching
# is I guess unexpected by most users.
