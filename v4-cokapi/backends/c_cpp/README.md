# C/C++ Visualizer Backend

2018-03-04: The C/C++ visualizer backend lives here now

It used to be in a separate repo located at:
https://github.com/pgbovine/opt-cpp-backend

I still use it for issue tracking for legacy reasons:
https://github.com/pgbovine/opt-cpp-backend/issues

Former README.md file from that repo:

This is the repo for the C/C++ backend for Online Python Tutor (http://pythontutor.com/)

Deployed online at:

- http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#py=c (for C)
- http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#py=cpp (for C++)

This code is based on a hacked version of Valgrind 3.11.0, downloaded from:
http://www.valgrind.org/downloads/valgrind-3.11.0.tar.bz2

Build dependencies:
- (basic Linux C compiler toolchain)
- binutils-dev
