Checked out my own copy of https://github.com/daveagp/java_jail in early
Feb 2014 into here as java_jail/, then made some local tweaks. (I didn't
use git submodules since I couldn't figure out how to check in my local
tweaks in a sensible way, ugh.)

Create a Docker container using "make" and then test it using "make test"

Use ../../cokapi.js as the webserver to invoke the Docker container


March 2018: VERY IMPORTANT: the java visualizer relies on this specific
version of the JDK since that's what Dave Pritchard tested it on circa
2013, so it's packaged in this directory: jdk1.8.0_20/

Note that this directory originally came from this zip file:

  jdk-8u20-linux-x64.tar.gz

... which can still be found on the Oracle website (Google for it), but
it just doesn't fit into the repo since GitHub has a 100MB size limit
for files.

Running with newer version of the JDK will lead to intermittent failures
that I'm not quite sure how to debug.
