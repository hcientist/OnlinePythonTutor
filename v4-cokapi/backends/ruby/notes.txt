Starting to learn Ruby to build an OPT backend for it ... relevant notes

test cases in tests/

gets is like raw_input, so should support that eventually since
raw_input is a pretty popular OPT feature

must richly support lambdas -- TODO: what are they called in ruby?!?

ok there's local variable scoping even within a loop, which doesn't
exist in Python/JS. so we might need more frames than just for function
calls

global variables are prefaced with $, but they're ugly and non-idiomatic
but 'constants' (identifiers starting with a capital letter) can also be
global in scope

since everything is an object in Ruby, we need to make some
simplifications for the visualization; e.g., it's overkill to show the
entire class hierarchy for a 'primitive' Fixnum (number) object.

Terminology translation:
  Python 'list', Ruby 'array'
  Python 'dict', Ruby 'hash'

Ruby strings are mutable ... but i don't think that affects the
visualization at all

Ruby block is crucial for scoping! need to definitely support it well
  - maybe extract out the actual source code for the block to display
    it, like we do for JS funcs?

symbols should probably be rendered specially

hmmm, how do we visualize 'extensions' to built-in classes, such as:

class Array
  def iterate!
    self.each_with_index { |n, i|
      self[i] = yield(n)
    }
  end
end

see
http://www.reactive.io/tips/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/
choice excerpt: "So to recap, we went through Rubyâ€™s four closure types,
blocks, Procs, lambdas and Methods. We also know that blocks and Procs
act like drop-in code snippets, while lambdas and Methods act just like
methods."

A lambda is simply a block with a name. but Proc (with a capital P)
isn't the same as a lambda. a lambda is simply an anonymous method.


Look into using reflection methods such as Kernel::local_variables,
Object::instance_variables, global_variables, constants, methods,
instance_methods, etc.

Use 'set' subtraction using '-':
  class Dog
    attr :bark, true
  end
  Dog.instance_methods - Object.instance_methods

or even better, use Dog.instance_methods(false) to not get your
ancestors' methods!

we need to display 'module' contents and how a class includes (points
to) a module, since that's a central concept for mixins

interesting -- classes can be 'opened' multiple times and have stuff
added to them (even stdlib classes)


it looks like we should target Ruby 2.X since there's the TracePoint
class for easy tracing:
http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/TracePoint.html

the byebug debugger builds upon it:
https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug

StringIO could be useful:
http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/stringio/rdoc/StringIO.html

maybe use eval as well?

to get debugger inspector functionality in Ruby 2.x, use:

gem install debug_inspector
gem install binding_of_caller

Also see here for inspirational example code for getting a pretty backtrace:
