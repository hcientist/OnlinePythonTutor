Name:
Remove duplicate characters

Question:

Write a function to return a new string that contains the contents of
the input string (in the original order) with all duplicate characters
removed.

Hint:
Think about using a set to keep track of already-seen characters.

Solution:
Iterate through the input string and keep already-seen characters in a
set.  If a character hasn't been seen yet, then append it to an output
list.  Finally convert the list into a string using "''.join()" and then
return it.

Skeleton:

def removeDups(s):
    # write your solution code here

// # Example solution:
// def removeDups(s):
//     seen = set()
//     out = []
//     for c in s:
//         if c not in seen:
//             out.append(c)
//         seen.add(c)
//     return ''.join(out)

Test:
input = "AAAABBBBB"
result = removeDups(input)

Expect:
result = "AB"

Test:
input = "Hello World"
result = removeDups(input)

Expect:
result = "Helo Wrd"

Test:
input = "Hello World"
result = removeDups(input)

Expect:
result = "Helo Wrd"

Test:
input = "alibaba"
result = removeDups(input)

Expect:
result = "alib"

Test:
input = "abcdefg"
result = removeDups(input)

Expect:
result = "abcdefg"


Test:
input = ""
result = removeDups(input)

Expect:
result = ""
