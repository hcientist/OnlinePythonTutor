Name:
Two-sum

Question:

Write a function to return the sum of the two largest elements in the
given list (assuming you're given a list with at least two elements).

Hint:
Can you find the largest element?  How about the second largest?  Or
think about sorting.

Solution:
Scan through the list twice to find the two largest elements, then sum
them (or sort and sum the two largest elements).

Skeleton:

def sumTwoLargest(lst):
    # write your solution code here

Test:
input = [5,3,4,7,10]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 17

Test:
input = [5,4,3,2,1]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 9

Test:
input = [3,7]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 10

Test:
input = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 2

Test:
input = [1,9,5,7,3]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 16


Test:
input = [1,2,5,3,5,4]
result = sumTwoLargest(input)

Expect:
result = 10
