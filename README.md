Python Tutor -- http://pythontutor.com/ -- helps people overcome a fundamental barrier to learning programming: understanding what happens as the computer executes each line of a program's source code. Using this tool, you can write Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++ programs in your Web browser and visualize what the computer is doing step-by-step as it executes those programs.

This tool was created by [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/) in January 2010. [See project history](history.txt).

[List of unsupported features and known bugs](https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/unsupported-features.md)

The latest development version of the code is in [v5-unity](v5-unity/),
although lots of legacy documentation still resides in [v3](v3/).


### Quick Start

BY FAR the most preferred way to use Python Tutor is via the official website, since it contains the latest updates: http://pythontutor.com/

You can use [iframe embedding](v3/docs/embedding-HOWTO.md) to easily embed visualizations on your webpage.

If you want to run locally on your own computer, to run Python visualizations try:

```
pip install bottle # make sure the bottle webserver (http://bottlepy.org/) is installed
cd OnlinePythonTutor/v5-unity/
python bottle_server.py
```

You should see the visualizer at: http://localhost:8003/visualize.html

... and the live programming environment at: http://localhost:8003/live.html 

However, it can be hard to run your own visualizer locally for
non-Python languages, since there are complex dependencies in v4-cokapi/ that
I haven't yet cleanly packaged up. By default, the local version you run will
*call my own server to run the non-Python backends*, so please be mindful of
your bandwidth usage.

For further directions, see [Overview for Developers](v3/docs/developer-overview.md) or explore the [rest of the docs](v3/docs/).
