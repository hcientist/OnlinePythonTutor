# Tests to make sure that OPT tracks execution from user code (foo) to a
# function in an external module (callback_module.callback_func) and
# then back out to user code (bar). If all goes well, then both foo and
# bar will be displayed on the stack. Ideally
# callback_module.callback_func should also be on the stack, but since
# OPT doesn't trace external code, it simply ignores that stack entry.

# The incorrect behavior is NOT to trace inside of bar.


import callback_module

def foo():
  callback_module.callback_func(bar)

def bar():
    print("I'm in a bar!!!")
