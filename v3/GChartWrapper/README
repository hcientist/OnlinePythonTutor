TODO: add support for GraphViz charts:
  https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/gallery/graphviz
  GraphViz hack to render balanced binary trees:
    http://www.graphviz.org/content/FaqBalanceTree

  JSON-based callback support for image maps so that you can click on
  the generated graphs:
    https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/gallery/graphviz

e.g.,:
  http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=gv&chl=digraph{C[penwidth=2,color=red],A-%3EB-%3EC-%3EA,C-%3ED,D-%3EE,D-%3EF}

and tweaked to remove dependency on utf-8 encoding, which seems to trip
up parts of OPT, and to remove unnecessary imports (for security and
efficiency reasons)
