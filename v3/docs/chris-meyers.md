Starting in Summer 2013, Chris has been adding support for
[custom HTML rendering modules](https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/docs/html-rendering.md)
in Online Python Tutor. His first two modules were:

- [htmlFrame.py](https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/htmlFrame.py)
- [matrix.py](https://github.com/pgbovine/OnlinePythonTutor/blob/master/v3/matrix.py)


### Chris Meyers short bio (Sep 2013) ###

I have been a software engineer for most of my working life, primarily in the newspaper industry. I've recently retired and now live in both Eugene Oregon and Bremen Germany.

I received a BA in Physics from the University of Oregon and later a Masters degree in Computer Science.

I've been using Python since 1995 and it has been by far my favorite programming language
since then. At the newspaper where I worked (The Register Guard) we used it whenever we could,
and especially with tools such as Django. 

I have been part of the open source community. I was a co-author for the book ["How to Think like a Computer Scientist (Python)"](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/)
along with Allen Downey and Jeff Elkner in 2002.
I also have a web page [Python for Fun][p4f] aimed at intermediate programmers and students.

This latest project with Philip has been fun and challenging.
Online Python Tutor has been a great success in helping people visualize code running and we hope this addition will help with the visualization of whole algorithms running as well.
