As of 2016-07-27, this v3 version is obsolete and has been replaced with
../v5-unity/

All new development is taking place on v5-unity right now (until a new
version comes along!)

Note that lots of documentation still remains here since I don't have
time to clean it up right now.

Thanks to John DeNero, this version works on both Python 2 and 3.

All documentation is viewable online at:
